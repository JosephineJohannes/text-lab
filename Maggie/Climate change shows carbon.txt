In July, western fires hazed eastern states’ skies, painting the full moon a mysterious Mars-like orange. Then, in early August, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued a red alert that human activity is unequivocally causing climate change! Then, the headline “Dozens killed in Northeast by storm’s remnants” (News, Sept. 3). Subways flooded and the story read, “Experts said it was slightly exacerbated by climate change — warmer air holds more rain.” For years, climate scientists have been saying that humancaused climate change is a threat multiplier strengthening hurricanes and increasing rainfall.
July’s carbon dioxide levels in our skies were 416 parts per million, while back in the 1830s they were around 284 parts per million. That excess results from human activity, especially burning fossil fuels.
It’s time we act responsibly. Adding a carbon price to the budget reconciliation package makes sense. Like getting a COVID-19 vaccine, it reduces future threats.
