Contrary to the Biden administration and the news media, climate change is not the most pressing issue this county faces. Instead, it’s at the bottom of the list for the American public.
President Biden’s open borders immigration policies have created uncontrolled chaos for U.S. citizens. And it’s obvious that those who want to change America are attempting to change the political demographics of Texas to Democrat. The Democratic party wants to assure that outcome and wants to federalize elections before the 2022 midterms.
