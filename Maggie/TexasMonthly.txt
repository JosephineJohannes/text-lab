Texas Tech Professor Katharine Hayhoe, one of the foremost climate science experts in the world, appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live Wednesday evening to talk climate change and communication.
She was promoting her new book, "Saving Us: A Climate Scientist's Case for Hope and Healing in a Divided World."
Hayhoe is the co-director of the Texas Tech University Climate Center and is the Endowed Professor in Public Policy and Public Law in the Texas Tech Political Science Department.
Kimmel talked with Hayhoe about her life as a climate expert in the middle of conservative oil country, and the intersection of her evangelical beliefs with climate change science.
Late night comedy hosts coordinated efforts Wednesday to produce shows with elements dedicated to the effects of climate change. In other words, it was Climate Night.
The topics ranged from The Daily Show with Trevor Noah tackling sea turtle gender in a segment dedicated to little known consequences of climate change, to Late Night with Seth Meyers devoting his Closer Look segment to the Green New Deal and fossil fuel lobbyists.
Talking about the impacts of climate change is exactly what Hayhoe said society should be doing.
"There is one thing that everyone can do, and we're not doing it," she told Kimmel, who asked her what that was.
"Talk about it," Hayhoe said. "Only 14% are actually talking about it. And if you don't talk, why would you care? And if you don't care, why would you do anything about it?"
In 2014, Hayhoe was named to the TIME 100, Time Magazine's list of influential people for 2014, according to A-J Media archives.
In 2017 and 2018, Hayhoe played a key role as the lead author of the first and second volumes of the Fourth U.S. National Climate Assessment published by the U.S. Global Change Research Program, as well as participating in the Nobel Peace Prize forum and giving a TED Talk on climate solutions that has received more than 1.9 million views.
Hayhoe also was awarded the eighth Stephen H. Schneider Award for Outstanding Climate Science Communication in 2018.
In 2017, she was named one of Fortune's 50 Greatest World Leaders, which honors men and women across the globe who are helping to change the world and inspiring others to do the same. In 2016, she was named to the annual Politico 50 list, which recognizes those in society who help shape policy and thinking in the U.S.
The full episode of Wednesday's Jimmy Kimmel Live can be streamed on Hulu, however, Hayhoe's appearance can be found for free on Youtube

Highlight: Surprising statements by oil industry leaders have grabbed headlines. But the bigger change is under way more quietly, among young Republicans.

On January 10, 1901, Spindle top gushed forth near Beaumont, ushering in the age of oil. An unholy amount of money blanketed Texas, materializing in pocketbooks as if manifested by God. Then, 119 years and four days later, Todd Staples, the president of the Texas Oil and Gas Association, a trade organization for several thousand firms associated with the state's fossil fuel industries, got on the phone to take questions from the media about the group's periodic efforts to keep that money flowing-specifically, its plans for the 2020 election. Things took an unexpected turn.
A reporter pointed out that the midterms, in 2018, saw a surge in young voters, who are much more likely than older folks to say they want the government to take action on climate change. Did that concern TXOGAP Staples responded that the organization considered itself an ally of those voters. "The oil and natural gas industry is absolutely committed to climate progress," he said, "and we want to help get the message out that no one is investing more in low-carbon technology. Every voter needs to know we share a common goal of a lower-emissions future."
It was a pretty milquetoast statement but a remarkable one coming from Staples. A staunch Republican and former Texas agriculture commissioner, Staples spent his time in office attacking proposals to address climate change and once urged the U.S. Department of Agriculture to fire all its "treasonous" employees involved in promoting "Meatless Monday," an international climate-conscious campaign to eat vegetarian once a week. In 2010 Staples joined Governor Rick Perry and Attorney General Greg Abbott to promote the state's lawsuits against the Obama-era Environmental Protection Agency as it attempted to curb the nation's carbon emissions, and all three sowed confusion about climate science in the process.
The idea that limiting greenhouse gases would be good, which Staples was endorsing, implies that emissions are in some way bad or have negative consequences, a concession with sweeping implications for TXOGA members, not to mention the broader Texas economy. If emitting carbon at current levels is harmful, then it follows, even from a conservative perspective, that the state ought to curb carbon, at least when practical. Was the mouthpiece of Texas Oil calling, indirectly, for a crackdown on the flaring of natural gas or for limits on methane emissions from leaky pipelines? For an end to the massive state and federal subsidies for fossil fuels? Or even for electric cars, solar farms, and nuclear power? Was Staples playing the role of Mikhail Gorbachev, and was this his glasnost (or, ahem, his gasnost)?
Staples took another question: Did TXOGA agree that burning oil and gas contributed to climate change? "We believe that all emissions contribute to climate change, and we believe that our industry is committed to doing our part," Staples said. "Every emission, wood that's burned, there's carbon emissions from multiple sources, and to have a real conversation, we need to look at all sources."
The suggestion that a family in, say, Burundi, with a wood-burning stove is a coequal culprit in the warming of the planet is an indication that Staples was not exactly channeling Greta Thunberg. But the timing was itself telling. He spoke as unprecedented wildfires ravaged vast swaths of Australia, a leading exporter of coal, putting pressure on Australia's conservative prime minister to acknowledge the country's significant carbon output, even as he said he would protect the coal industry. In the United States, there are other signs of a thawing of hard-line messaging on climate change, even during the rule of an administration steadfastly opposed to doing anything about the problem. The American Petroleum Institute, the national counterpart to TXOGA, recently started referring more to the "natural gas and oil" industry, instead of "oil and gas," emphasizing the more climate-friendly fuel, at least if produced and transported appropriately.
About a week after Staples's concession, at an event hosted by the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation, Texas congressman Dan Crenshaw, a 36-year-old former Navy SEAL who has positioned himself as the face of millennial conservatism, introduced a small disturbance in the force by telling the audience that Republicans needed to start taking environmental issues, including climate change, seriously. Crenshaw noted that the environment regularly ranked as a top concern for Democrats, Republicans, and independents alike. "We can make fun of the left's sort of alarmist views on climate change, and we should, to an extent, but we can't ignore it completely," he said, because they were "not totally untrue." Crenshaw said the GOP should emphasize that climate change could be solved by "innovation, research, and development," which is more politically palatable to voters than asking them to give up steaks and pickup trucks.
Not a particularly radical sentiment: Crenshaw's suggestion is still to the "right" of virtually every major conservative party in the developed world. But again, you have to take into account the speaker and his audience. The Texas Public Policy Foundation has ties to fossil fuel interests, and in recent years it has spent generously on a campaign to hobble the thriving Texas wind-power industry while protecting the vast government subsidies that still flow to the oil, gas, and coal industries.
Around the same time that Crenshaw made his comments, Houston's elite businesspeople gathered for the annual meeting of the Greater Houston Partnership, the powerful business association at the heart of the oil-driven city. In almost any other context, Chair Bobby Tudor's message to the audience of oil and gas types would have been seen as an invocation of conventional wisdom, but here it was brave, or at least bold: "A consensus has emerged among scientists, business leaders, and the general public that climate change is a real problem that requires urgent attention from all of us, and that we therefore will be using less hydrocarbon-based energy sources."
The industry was "dramatically out of favor at the moment, in most every corner of the investing and political world," he said, and it needed urgently to adapt. "At its most basic level, I think we can all agree that having less CO2 emissions in the atmosphere would be a good thing-and as Houston's business leaders, we need to be committed to working to make that happen."
For skeptics inclined to think the change in rhetoric was just a PR move, Staples for one was ready to oblige. Two days after his call with reporters, he went on the public radio show the Texas Standard to clean up his spill. It seemed as if he had intended to signal a change in messaging but was surprised by how seriously everyone had taken it. "I think the term 'climate change' has been hijacked. I think it's been used to unfortunately introduce climate hysteria or climate confusion. I think the term is used in such a way to confuse the public that the sky is falling in," he said.
Much of the industry reacted to Staples's message-and his subsequent walkback-with a shrug. But some were angry. "Unfortunately, many of these large companies feel the need to apologize rather than stepping up and talking about the dramatic impact cheap, reliable energy has made on our standard of living," said Kathy Shannon, the executive director of the Permian Basin Petroleum Museum, in Midland. The right-wing advocacy organization Texas Scorecard accused Staples of "jumping on the liberal bandwagon." One conservative blogger wrote that "one can only assume that Staples is now a non-climate-denier in order to reach future political heights," perhaps mollifying the left in advance of a new political run. "He's prepping as a Beto clone."
Of course, there's something a little ridiculous about parsing statements from oil and gas trade groups at a time when Australia and the Amazon are burning. There's a kind of recurrent amnesia that paints climate change as a perennially "new" problem, an issue that is just reaching critical mass of awareness.
It's shocking today to reflect on just how much we've known all along and how much we've decided to ignore. Since at least the early 1800s, scientists have been aware of the greenhouse gas effect. In 1856 scientist Eunice Foote established that carbon dioxide was remarkably efficient at trapping infrared heat, like that from the sun, and theorized that a carbon-saturated atmosphere would spike the earth's temperature. By the 1890s, in the years before Spindletop, researchers had moved on to the question of how fast carbon emissions would heat the earth.
And it's not as if this scientific knowledge was a secret either. In the 1950s, a short educational film directed by Frank Capra in a cheery midcentury style and screened at schools across the country showed a scientist predicting that thanks to the "waste products of civilization," future tourists would possibly one day board "glass-bottom boats" to get a glimpse of "the drowned towers of Miami." Political leaders were also aware of the problem. In the 1980s, politicians as conservative as George H.W. Bush and Margaret Thatcher warned of the urgent threat posed by climate change. As recently as 2008, the presidential candidates of both parties had sweeping plans to rein in carbon emissions. These periods of awareness come and go.
When pressure builds, the industries with the biggest carbon footprints adopt new messaging, and then the pressure dissipates, and life, and heating, goes on. While Staples's announcement is significant, it also fits neatly into that unfortunate pattern. Which is especially galling, because the industry he represents has known what's going on for years. Thanks to dogged reporting by Inside Climate News and the Los Angeles Times, we know that as early as 1977, Texas oil giant Exxon, a prominent member of TXOGA, was not only producing its own scientific climate models that calculated future warming trends but also using that knowledge to plan its long-term investments. The next year, Exxon's chief scientist warned internally that "present thinking holds that man has a time window of five to ten years before the need for hard decisions regarding changes in energy strategies might become critical." Yet for decades more, the company funded campaigns to muddy the waters and forestall political action-decisions that have not only spawned a wave of lawsuits against Exxon but also transformed the very physical and chemical composition of the atmosphere.
In light of this history, it might seem as if nothing will ever change-at least not in time to stave off the grimmest future scenarios predicted by scientists. But that's too pessimistic a view. There are reasons for hope, and one of them comes from a most unexpected source: young Republicans.
Benji Backer is a clean-cut, wholesome-looking Wisconsin conservative who cut his teeth arguing with teachers in high school about Republican governor Scott Walker's fight with public unions. But now, at the age of 22, he's the president and founder of the American Conservation Coalition, which is trying to sell the Republican party on environmental issues. The group draws inspiration from the legacy of Teddy Roosevelt and Richard Nixon, who championed national parks and oversaw the creation of the EPA, respectively.
Backer knows something that both Staples and Crenshaw alluded to in their remarks: on climate change, young Republicans are closer to Democrats in many ways than older Republicans. A pivotal moment in Backer's political awakening came when he attended the Conservative Political Action Conference, at the time an important annual gathering of movement conservatives.
There, he connected with other young conservatives who, he learned, considered traditional social issues, like gay marriage, to be irrelevant. Instead, Backer says, the activists wanted to talk about climate change, "a number one issue throughout their entire lives."
Public opinion surveys bear this out. In October, the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas revealed a stark generational gap among Republicans on the issue of climate. Only 33 percent of Texas Republicans over forty said they thought climate change was happening, compared to a whopping 70 percent of those under forty. Of those young Republicans who believe it is happening, 61 percent said they're "very" or "somewhat" worried. Those under-forty Republicans are even more likely to be "very worried" about climate change than independents of all ages.
Such surveys may actually undersell generational differences. As one conservative pointed out to me, young Republicans over the age of thirty or so grew up during the culture wars of the 2000s and developed a distaste for environmentalists, exemplified by Al Gore and the South Park character "ManBearPig"-a cartoon reflection of the popular view that people who talked about climate change were smug, hypocritical weirdos. Young Republicans like Backer don't see things that way. Even within young Republican groups, Backer says, the gap between younger and older members can be cavernous.
The American Conservation Coalition, it should be said, is not influential, at least not yet. Other conservatives have mocked the group, and only a few elected officials have endorsed its mission, mostly Republicans from the Northeast and the Pacific Northwest. But Backer and his peers stress to other Republicans that climate policy can be a bridge to a younger generation that generally views the party with disdain. And they warn their elders that they'll be forced to align with Democrats if the GOP refuses to move on an issue some young Republicans feel is existential. "Republicans will keep losing the youth vote if they don't rethink this," Backer says.
Backer's group isn't alone. Students for Carbon Dividends is a confederation of College Republican clubs that supports the idea of imposing a price on carbon and returning the proceeds to Americans in the form of a tax rebate. Its founding coalition included College Republican and Young Conservative chapters at Texas Christian University, Trinity University in San Antonio, and the University of Houston.
Though the news media focuses on left-wing climate activists, these conservatives might have more of an influence on the climate debate, polarized as it is. But as they know, they're running out of time to make a mark.

Highlight: TEXAS TECH'S KATHERINE HAYHOE IS ONE OF THE MOST RESPECTED EXPERTS ON GLOBAL WARMING IN THE COUNTRY. SHE'S ALSO AN EVANGELICAL CHRISTIAN WHO IS TRYING TO CONNECT WITH THE VERY PEOPLE WHO MOST DOUBT HER RESEARCH. TOO BAD THE TEMPERATURE KEEPS RISING.
Body


One clear day last spring, Katharine Hayhoe walked into the limestone chambers of the Austin City Council to brief the members during a special meeting on how prepared the city was to deal with disasters and extreme weather. A respected atmospheric scientist at Texas Tech University, the 43-year-old had been invited to discuss climate change, and she breezed through her Power Point slides, delivering stark news in an upbeat manner: unless carbon emissions were swiftly curbed, in the coming decades Texas would see stronger heat waves, harsher summers, and torrential rainfall separated by longer periods of drought.
"Why do we care about all of this stuff?" Hayhoe asked. "Because it has huge financial impacts." The number of billion-dollar weather disasters in the United States had ballooned from one or two per year in the eighties to eight to twelve today, Hay hoe explained as she pulled up a slide with a map of the country. "Texas is in the crosshairs of those events, because we get it all, don't we? We get the floods and the droughts, the hailstorms and the ice storms, and even the snow and the extreme heat. And we get the tornadoes, the hurricanes, and the sea-level rise. There isn't much that we don't get."
Soon afterward, Don Zimmerman, a conservative councilman who, before being elected, regularly sued the city overtax increases, declared from his seat on the dais that climate change was a "nebulous" and "foolish" field of study. Zimmerman, wearing a banker's collar and projecting an officious air into the room, continued, "We have maybe thirty years of satellite data, and the world is maybe millions of years old. I have a really visceral reaction against the climate-change argument, for the simple reason that when you look back in time, there have been dramatic climate changes before humanity ever existed.
"The worst thing that can be done to humanity is put government bureaucrats in charge of carbon dioxide emissions," he said as Hayhoe listened politely. "You don't have to be as smart as a fifth grader to know that what causes the climate is the sun. I have people tell me, 'Carbon dioxide warms the earth.' No, it doesn't. The sun warms the earth, and there is more energy in our sun than humanity can comprehend." Zimmerman then insisted that the sun didn't need "a permit from the EPA" to emit solar flares.
An uncomfortable silence settled over the chamber for a moment before Hayhoe joked, "I think if the EPA could be in charge of the sun, that could create bigger problems than we have today." She then proceeded to gut Zimmerman's arguments. "A thermometer is not Democrat or Republican, and when we look around this world, it's not about trusting what our thirty-year-old satellites say. It's about looking at 26,500 indicators of a warming planet, many of them we can see in our own backyards," she said. The climate was not changing because of orbital cycles, which bring about ice ages, Hayhoe maintained. "The Earth's temperature peaked eight thousand years ago and was in a long, slow slide into the next ice age until the Industrial Revolution," she said. Instead of being in this cooling period, the planet had seen its average temperature steadily rise. The sun was also not the culprit: "If the climate were changing because of the sun, we'd be getting cooler, because energy from the sun has been going down over the last forty years," she said.
But Zimmerman, it seemed, had no use for facts, and after the meeting he continued to harangue Hayhoe. The encounter, however, came as no surprise. In fact, it was depressingly familiar to Hayhoe, who has auburn hair, hazel eyes, and a calm, affable nature that is reminiscent of an excellent physician's bedside manner. And she often likens herself to a doctor, but her patient is the planet. After taking its temperature, she feels compelled to report her diagnosis: because of man-made carbon emissions, the earth is running a fever. She knows that this message doesn't always find a receptive audience. Over the past fifteen years, climate change has emerged as one of the most polarizing issues in the country, ahead of guns, the death penalty, and abortion. And there is no group that is more unconvinced of climate change's reality than evangelical Christians, who primarily identify as conservative Republicans. As Brian Webb, the founder of the faith-based Climate Caretakers, recently told Religion News Service: "The United States is the only industrialized country in the world where denial of climate change has become inextricably linked to a dominant political party."
All of which puts Hay hoe in a unique position. A co-author of the last two National Climate Assessments and a reviewer on the Nobel Prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Hayhoe-the daughter of missionaries and the wife of a pastor-is herself an evangelical Christian. In her talks, she uses the Bible to explain to Christians why they should care about elimate change and how it affects other people, from a poor family on the island nation of Kiribati who will be displaced by rising sea levels to an elderly couple in Beaumont who can't afford to pay for air-conditioning in Texas's increasingly sweltering summers. As she puts it, "The poor, the disenfranchised, those already living on the edge, and those who contributed least to this problem are also those at greatest risk to be harmed by it. That's not a scientific issue; that's amoral issue."
Hayhoe maintains a dizzying schedule. In the past year, she has attended the historic United Nations climate summit in Paris, traveled to the edge of Hudson Bay, in Canada, to witness the annual polar bear migration, curated a special Good Housekeeping issue on climate change, and appeared onstage in New York with Gloria Steinem at a talk at the Rubin Museum of Art. That's in addition to teaching her graduate-level seminars, serving as a co-director of Texas Tech's Climate Science Center, and publishing seventeen scientific papers. (Travel is essential for Hayhoe's job but to do her part- and perhaps head off criticism about her carbon footprint-Hayhoe buys carbon offsets to reduce the impact of her trips.) One warm afternoon in October, on a day spent in Lubbock between visits to Colorado and Houston, Hay hoe spoke at a Phi Beta Kappa ice cream social inside Texas Tech's Hall of Nations, a room draped with the flags of 190 countries and featuring a glossy terrazzo map of the world on the floor. The crowd, mostly professors from across the university's departments and a smattering of students, dug into Styrofoam bowls of vanilla and cookies and cream as Hay hoe, who was wearing a red top and flowing linen pants, began her speech.
"I'm a professor here at Tech, and what I'm going to talk about today is not my research. I'm going to talk about the experience that I have talking about my research. Now, most of you are not going to have the same experience I do. If you study literature, you don't have to spend a lot of time convincing people that books are real. If you study engineering, most people will agree that engineering is real and it's an important part of our society. But I study something that about half of the country and much more than half of Texas thinks is a complete hoax," she said. "Many people view having climate science at Texas Tech as similar to having a Department of Astrology. But we don't use crystal balls, we use supercomputers; we rely on physics, not brain waves."
The study of climate science dates to 1824, when French physicist Joseph Fourier discovered what would become known as the greenhouse effect, in which gases trapped in the atmosphere absorb heat and raise the temperature of the planet. It took 35 more years for John Tyndall, an Irish chemist, to pinpoint carbon dioxide as one of the heat-trapping gases in the earth's atmosphere. And in 1896, a Swedish chemist named Svante Arrhenius declared that burning coal contributed to the greenhouse effect, after spending almost 2 years calculating (by hand!) how increasing carbon dioxide concentrations raised the earth's temperature. So the basic science, as Hay hoe often points out, has been settled since before the start of the twentieth century. Today, there is robust scientific consensus that global warming is "real, caused by humans, and dangerous"; a study found that 97 percent of climate scientists agree with those conclusions. The Department of Defense calls climate change a "threat multiplier," because it exacerbates existing problems. And the year 2015 was the warmest on record, breaking the previous mark, which was set in 2014.
So why is climate science greeted with so much skepticism? Part of the reason can be attributed to the way the topic is often handled in the media On cable news, two people from opposite sides of the debate are typically paired to argue about the subject, but that can lead to a false equivalency between scientists on the one hand and paid spokesmen on the other. As historians Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway chronicled in the book Merchants of Doubt, some of the most prominent climate-change skeptics are the same politically conservative scientists who were previously funded by Big Tobacco to spread falsehoods about cigarettes. Their employer this time around? The fossil-fuel industry.
And part of the reason is the suspicions that conservatives have of government intervention. Hayhoe has found that some people don't reject the reality of climate change because they disagree with the science but because they fear that the solutions will upend their lives. This seems to be the case for U.S. senator James Inhofe, a Republican from Oklahoma, who once told journalist Rachel Maddow, "I thought it must be true until I found out what it would cost." That day at Tech, Hayhoe recounted an anecdote about an experience she'd had speaking to a group of water managers for the Brazos River a few months back. At the end of that talk, an older man stood up and said, "Everything you said makes sense, but I don't want the government telling me where to set my thermostat."
Some critics feel so threatened that they resort to ad hominem attacks on climate scientists. Hayhoe receives a steady stream of hate mail, which she files away in a special folder. When I asked her when this started, she replied, "The first time I was ever quoted in a newspaper article." The ugliness reached its height in 2012, during the presidential race. At the time, Hayhoe was writing a chapter on global warming for a book Republican hopeful Newt Gingrich was co-authoring about the environment. Rush Limbaugh mentioned it on his radio program, dismissively referring to Hay hoe as a "climate babe." A few days later, an Iowa voter buttonholed Gingrich on camera to ask him about it, and Gingrich swiftly replied, "That's not going to be in the book. We didn't know that they were doing that-we told them to kill it." Hayhoe took to Twitter to respond: "What an ungracious way to find out, eh? Nice to hear that Gingrich is tossing my #climate chapter in the trash. 100+ unpaid hrs I cd've spent playing w my baby."
Most of the time, she laughs these incidents off "I got one today that was exceptional," she told me in late September, as we sat inside the Climate Science Center. "Most of the stuff is rambling, but this one was not. Someone wrote on Face book, 'She is a lying lunatic, and probably a witch.' That was very concise;' she said with a grin. But sometimes the comments veer into violent territory. Hayhoe recalls one email that prompted her to call authorities. "You are a mass murderer and will be convicted at the Reality TV Grand Jury in Nuremberg, Pennsylvania," the email began. "After the Grand Jury indicts you, I would like to see you convicted and beheaded by guillotine in the public square, to show women that if they are going to take a man's job, they have to take the heat for mass murder." But most of the time, Hayhoe doesn't let such vitriol drive her to despair, though dealing with it can be exhausting. "What frustrates me the most, and what I find difficult not to take personally, is how much of the hate mail comes from so-called Christians."
If she was going to leave astronomy behind, Hay hoe wanted to do policy-relevant climate science. When she was considering graduate programs, she was thrilled to learn that Don Wuebbles, who had been instrumental in addressing the chlorofluorocarbon problem in the eighties, was the new head of the department of atmospheric science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. He would serve as her adviser for both her master's degree and her doctorate. Under Wuebbles's guidance, Hayhoe eventually began focusing on statistical downscaling, which was still a relatively newfield when she started graduate school, in 1995. "There was very little of this being done at the time," Wuebbles recalled recently, "and the methods were not capturing the full extent of the science, so she set about to develop a new technique and very successfully did so. She's brilliant."
That bile is something Hayhoe never anticipated when she was applying to graduate school 22 years ago. A native of Toronto, she had double-majored in physics and astronomy at the University of Toronto and spent every clear night one summer gazing through the telescopes on top of the physics building. She found that the astronomer's life appealed to her and planned to study that in graduate school. Then she took a climatology class her junior year. "Until I took that course, I did not realize that climate change is affecting everything, from poverty to biodiversity to health, and so you can't fix anyone of them if you leave climate change out of the picture," she told me. She also realized that her background in physics had perfectly positioned her to study climate modeling.
Statistical down scaling involves combining historical weather observations with global climate models to better predict what the future could look like in a particular place. "The local environment, whether it's hilly or flat, with crops or forest, urban or rural, modifies the weather patterns we get," she said. "So, for example, if we had identical high-pressure systems over Lubbock and Houston, it would mean something different for the temperature, for the humidity, for the rainfall patterns." Hayhoe also tries to see if the global models reflect real-world conditions on the ground. "When we get an El Nino, we see a very :wet winter from here in Lubbock all the way across to Florida. Do the models pick that up or not? We need to know," she explained.
Hayhoe runs simulations on a supercomputer, then she combs through the data to interpret the output. On a practical level, this means Hay hoe exists in a world of numbers, thousands upon thousands of lines of them A single file dealing with one variable-say, temperature across the country over the next hundred years-can be almost five gigabytes in size. And she runs these simulations for multiple variables and scenarios on multiple climate models. (Some 42 global-climate models exist today, run by labs around the world.) These reams of data are shapeless until she translates them by writing code. "What a lot of people don't realize is that the most important skill any climate scientist has is programming," she told me over pizza in Lubbock one afternoon last fall.
Hayhoe has used down scaling in her consulting work for the cities of Washington, D.C.; Boulder; and Chicago, as well as federal entities, including the Department of Defense and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. She helps analyze problem areas, such as sewer overflow during heavy rain or warped train rails during heat waves, and tries to pinpoint how often those things will be a problem in the future, based on changing climate patterns. In 2004 Hayhoe was an author on a paper that examined California's future from different angles, from water supply to agriculture to tourism. She was heartened when, a few months later, that research prompted Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to sign an executive order limiting greenhouse-gas emissions. He was the first governor to do so. "When Schwarzenegger signed that bill, he had the authors from California standing in a semicircle behind him. The reason why I left astrophysics is to do policy-relevant research, and when I saw that picture, I thought to myself, 'I did it. This works.'"
Hayhoe's scientific credentials are impeccable, but what has made her an international star are her skills as a communicator. John Abraham, an associate professor of thermal sciences at the University of St. Thomas, in Minnesota, has called her "one of the best climate communicators in the world." Abraham told me, "She is extraordinary at relaying very complex topics into language that other people can understand, without speaking down to them. The other thing she's good at is hearing questions. We all listen, but she has this innate ability to understand the perspective of the person making the inquiry," he said. "She has this knack for honestly presenting the science but doing it in a disarming way for people who are often anti-science."
One mild Friday in early October, I flew to Houston with Hayhoe and her eight-year-old son, who spent the short flight absorbed in the game Minecraft on his iPad while Hayhoe tapped away on her laptop. She was to give a keynote speech at Memorial Drive Presbyterian Church, a collection of climestone buildings nestled between pine trees in one of Houston's most affluent neighborhoods. The weekend symposium was called "Faithful Alternatives to Fossil Fuel Divestment." Hayhoe arrived with some tough talk for her audience. "There's no way to sugarcoat this, and I wish I could, because I know I'm in Houston, but the way that we get our energy does matter. If we continue to rely only on fossil fuels, we're going to end up on a very different pathway than if we gradually and sensibly transition to clean and renewable energy that we can grow here in Texas-and that many of our energy companies are already investing in very heavily."
The conference was organized in response to the Presbyterian Church (USA)'s proposal to divest church resources from fossil fuels, a move the Houston chapter had rejected as a symbolic one that unfairly vilified the people who work in the fossil-fuel industry. The group instead proposed that the national organization take steps to reduce its carbon footprint and advocate for a carbon tax. Hayhoe, too, is a proponent of putting a price on carbon and letting the markets sort it out. She thinks that a reasonable tax on gasoline would be around 6 cents a gallon. "Regulations just get more and more complicated, and you have to hire new people to deal with them," she explained. "It gets expensive and difficult to plot your strategy, but any business-from the ma-and-pa shop around the corner to the biggest multinational in the world-knows what to do with a simple price change. Business is all about maximizing profit and minimizing costs. So in a sense, putting a price on carbon just frees up business to do what it does best."
But the most revealing part of her talk centered on why Christians should care about climate change. To lead into this subject, Hayhoe flipped to a slide with a quote from John Holdren, President Obama's science adviser: "We basically have three choices: mitigation, adaptation, or suffering. We're goingto do some of each. The question is what the mix is goingto be. The more mitigation we do, the less adaptation will be required and the less suffering there will be." Suffering, Hay hoe said, is not a word often deployed by scientists. "As scientists we don't know a lot about suffering, but as Christians we do. And we know that part of the reason we're here in this world is to help people who are suffering." And that suffering will not be meted out proportionally: if global warming con tinues unchecked, the poor-whether they're in Houston's Fifth Ward or in low-lying areas of Bangladesh- who have contributed least to carbon emissions will feel the most pain, from enduring more-intense heat waves to paying the higher food prices that will accompany failed crops. Throughout the Bible, God charges Christians to serve others, Hayhoe said, from Genesis, where God makes man in his image so that he can be responsible for every living creature on earth, to 1 Peter 4:10: '"Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God's grace in its various forms.'
"We've been given this commandment to love others as Christ loved us," Hayhoe said as a slide quoting John 13:34-35 flashed on the screen: "Let me give you a new command: love one another. In the same way I loved you, you love one another. This is how everyone will recognize that you are my disciples when they see the love you have for each other.'" She continued: "You can see, you just go through the Bible for verse after verse. They're not verses about climate change; they're not verses about the environment. They're verses about our attitudes and perspectives to other people on the planet. We are to be recognized for our love for other people." The members of the crowd nodded along in agreement as she spoke. The year 2015 was a good one to be proclaiming this message: in June, Pope Francis sent out his 192-page papal encyclical imploring the world's 1.2 billion Catholics to care about climate change, and in October, the National Association of Evangelicals issued a similar call to action.
Hayhoe can speak honestly about suffering because of a lesson she learned when her parents became missionaries and moved the family to Colombia when she was nine. There, she witnessed true poverty. Her father would travel to remote villages to speak at tiny churches, and she remembers hearing stories of landslides washing away homes after heavy rains. She now recognizes that these early memories of poverty and vulnerability have informed her work. Hayhoe was raised as a member of the Plymouth Brethren, a conservative, evangelical offshoot of the Anglican Church that emphasizes reading the Bible and interpreting it for oneself. This lent itself well to science, Hayhoe told me. ''My dad was very much of the perspective that the Bible is God's first book and nature-creation-is God's second book."
Though Hayhoe has always been serious about her faith, connecting with groups of fellow Christians about climate change was not something she did before moving to Texas. In 2006 she and her husband, Andrew Farley, relocated from South Bend, Indiana, to Lubbock, one of the most conservative cities in the country, so that they could both take jobs at Texas Tech, he as a linguistics professor, she as a researcher. He also became the pastor at a small nondenominational church on the southwest side of town, now called Church Without Religion. People were surprised when they learned what the pastor's wife did, and Far ley started getting lots of questions about it. And at Texas Tech, the invitations for Hayhoe to speak about climate change started rolling in. The volume of these questions and the lack of resources to point people to spurred her and Farley to write a book together, A Climate for Change: Global Warming Facts for Faith-Based Decisions. The questions they tackle in the book were familiar territory for the couple, who had met through a Christian organization while in graduate school. A few months into their marriage, Hay hoe realized that Farley, who had grown up in a conservative household in Virginia, did not think climate change was real, and they began vigorously debating the topic. "It took about two years, but now we're on the same side," she said.
But beyond just speaking to Christian groups, Hay hoe prides herself on being able to talk to anyone with an open mind about the reality of climate change. She bemoans the fact that global warming has come to be viewed as a niche environmental issue. "To care about climate change, all you have to be, pretty much, is a human living on planet Earth. You can be exactly who you are with exactly the values you have, and I can show you how those values connect to climate change," Hay hoe told me.
Hayhoe's first step is always to "genuinely bond over a shared value," with an emphasis on that shared value's being genuine. "The key is not to pretend; we can all smell someone who is not genuine a mile away," she said. 'If I'm talking to farmers or ranchers or water managers, I start off by talking about what we all care about, which is making sure we have water. And. that, for many Texans, is almost as strong of a value as whatever it says in the Bible.'' Her next step is to connect that issue to climate change. So when talking about water, she describes how climate change is changing rainfall patterns. "We're getting these heavy downpours, and then we're getting longer dry periods in between, and our droughts are getting stronger because the warmer it is, the more water evaporates out of our lakes and rivers and our soil," she said. She tries to end her talks with solutions that inspire people, ranging from the personal (measuring your carbon footprint and installing energy-efficient light bulbs) to the large-scale (putting a tax on carbon). Hayhoe herself is most excited by the efforts of Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla Motors and founder of SpaceX. 'If I had to pick one person to save the world -and I don't think any one person will but if I had to pick one-it would be him." She is excited about the battery packs that Tesla is developing, declaring energy storage the "single technology that will make the most difference."
Ultimately, she does not care whether people agree with the science, so long as they take action. She compares this to a battle waged in the mid -1800's, before the germ theory of disease gained widespread acceptance, when a Hungarian physician urged other doctors to wash their hands and instruments before delivering babies. As doctors changed their habits, fewer and fewer women died from "childbed fever." "I don't care if they thought germs are imaginary, so long as they washed their hands," she said. The same is true for climate change, in Hayhoe's mind. If people start using more-efficient light bulbs or driving more- fuel-friendly cars, it doesn't matter what they think about the science.
Hay hoe is coy about her own personal politics; and this air of mystery is useful to her. When I asked her about another Canadian- born Texan, climate-change skeptic and senator Ted Cruz, she demurred. She's a U.S. permanent resident but not a citizen, so she can't vote in the presidential election, and she seems to enjoy the level of remove this gives her from American politics. "It helps me not to pick sides, because people always ask if you're Democrat or Republican, and I'm neither. I can't be," she told me. "I appreciate the solutions that some Republicans are starting to advance, and I appreciate the fact that Democrats accept the science. But it's become so polarized that the good people on both sides are being marginalized." Whoever the next president is, Hayhoe hopes he or she will honor the commitments made at the climate summit in Paris last year and also put a price on carbon.
Hayhoe's religious background led NOVA's Secret Life of Scientists and Engineers to dub her a "climate change evangelist" in 2011, and the label has stuck, though she is lukewarm on it. "An evangelist is someone who spreads good news, and I feel like I'm not really evangelizing. I feel more like a Cassandra, or an Old Testament prophet spreading bad news, saying, 'If thou dost not change from thy wicked ways and repent, thou shalt reap the harvest of thy deeds."' But when Hay hoe talks, she doesn't sound so pessimistic. That's a strategic choice, as she realizes that doom and despair won't motivate others to act. For that, you need hope. "You have to offer people a vision of what the world could look like if we could wean ourselves off fossil fuels, if we could have a clean-energy economy," she said. "We would all want to live in that world."
Lyndon Baines Johnson was at his ranch outside Johnson City recuperating from gallbladder surgery on November 5, 1965, when his science advisers published a 317- page report warning about the dangers of air pollution. Tucked away in an appendix were 23 pages about atmospheric carbon dioxide. "Through his worldwide industrial civilization, Man is unwittingly conducting a vast geophysical experiment," the report states. "Within a few generations he is burning the fossil fuels that slowly accumulated in the earth over the past 500 million years." This additional carbon in the atmosphere would, over time, raise the earth's temperature, slowly melt the antarctic ice cap, and lead to increased ocean acidity, the report proclaimed. "The climate changes that may be produced by the increased C02 content could be deleterious from the point of human beings," the report concluded.
Fifty years later, Hay hoe gave the capstone presentation at a day long symposium in Washington commemorating the first time a president was warned about the danger of climate change. ''As several have already said today, we are conducting an experiment with our planet on a scale that has never before been attempted," she said, echoing the words of the report. The climate models that scientists now use churn out petabytes of data which is something like, in Hayhoe's words, "twenty million four-drawer filing cabinets full of text"-that then need to be analyzed to see how these changes will manifest in particular locales. "What's the point of doing all of that modeling and all of that analysis if we don't understand how it's going to affect the system right here that we care about?"
Would LBJ even recognize the future Texas predicted by these models? In the past fifty years, temperatures in Texas have risen half a degree per decade and are set to rise at least 3.5 degrees by mid-century if global emissions aren't slashed. "Our average summer could look like 2011 within my lifetime if we continue on our current pathway," Hayhoe told an audience in October, referencing that scorching summer when much of Texas saw more than one hundred 100-degree days. Austin could feel more like Scottsdale, Arizona. Rainfall patterns are shifting, so the state will face longer dry spells punctuated by more bouts of heavy rain. In West Texas, farming and ranching communities have thrived in the semiarid environment by pulling water from aquifers. But as the aquifers dry up, these communities are relying more on rainfall, just as that rainfall is becoming less likely and droughts are getting more intense, Hayhoe said. In LBJ's beloved Hill Country, this means increased risk of fire. Humans are the ones igniting the fires, but climate change is making them worse by providing the ideal dry conditions they need to spread. On the Gulf Coast, where a quarter of the state's 27 million people live, sea levels are already eight inches higher than they were a hundred years ago and are set to rise an additional one to four feet by the end of the century. And then there's the danger from stronger hurricanes fueled by record-breaking ocean temperatures.
Texas leaders, however, seem unwilling to tackle the problem or even admit that it exists. Governor Greg Abbott has long voiced skepticism about the science of climate change, telling the editorial board of the San Antonio Express-News during his gubernatorial campaign that the climate has always changed overtime and further study was needed. "We must be good guardians of our earth, but we must base our decisions on peer-reviewed scientific inquiry, free from political demagogues using climate change as an excuse to remake the American economy," he told the newspaper. As attorney general, Abbott made a habit of suing the Obama administration, oftentimes over regulatory issues relating to climate change. His successor, Ken Paxton, is continuing that tradition, joining a lawsuit in October over the administration's Clean Power Plan, which calls on states to curb emissions by phasing out coal plants and shifting to natural gas and renewables. The plan would require Texas to decrease its coal power capacity by 4,000 megawatts, or 25 percent, and Paxton has likened this to the EPA's mounting a "war on coal and fossil fuels."
In such a milieu, efforts to incorporate elimate change into planning at the state level have fallen flat, and bills that attempt to address it have gone nowhere in recent years in the Legislature. "At the state level, in some circles, climate change is still a taboo subject," John Nielsen-Gammon, the state climatologist, told me. This leaves cities to do their own resilience planning. Meanwhile, entities such as the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the operator of the state's electric grid, are not taking climate change into account when developing their projections for load growth, which could lead to problems as the mercury creeps upward.
In Congress, Texans are some of the most vocal climate-change skeptics. Congressman Lamar Smith, a Republican from San Antonio, has used his chairmanship of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee to tussle with federal agencies over their climate-change research, going so far as to subpoena the scientists who conducted a study with a conclusion he disagreed with and demand their emails. (Smith, it is worth noting, has received more than $600,000 in campaign donations from the fossil-fuel industry over his 29 years in Congress.) And then there's Cruz, who in December held a three-hour Senate hearing titled "Data or Dogma? Promoting Open Inquiry in the Debate Over the Magnitude of Human Impact on Earth's Climate," at which he claimed that there was a lack of scientific consensus on global warming.
Hayhoe is hopeful that as green energy gets cheaper, more people will begin using it. "Texas is unique, in that it is one of the states that have the most to lose economically from climate-change impacts, but Texas also has the most to gain by transitioning to a clean-energy economy," Hay hoe told me one day in her office on campus, a cluttered, windowless space. The room's sole decorative flair, a papier-maché arctic fox that was a Christmas present from her young son, sat perched on a shelf.
If Texas were its own country, it would be the seventh-most-prolific emitter of carbon dioxide in the world. As it stands, Texas is the number one emitter in the U.S.; it released some 641 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in 2013, almost double that of California.
But the state also has a seemingly boundless potential for green energy. Texas leads the nation in wind generation; turbines produced a full 10 percent of the state's power in 2015. By 2030, that number is forecast to jump to 37 percent. One night last September, supply of wind power was so plentiful and demand was so low that the spot price of electricity went negative for a few hours. Solar installation has lagged behind, but when it ramps up, there's enough capacity just in the hundred-square-mile area between Plainview and Amarillo to light the entire United States, as Hay hoe likes to point out. In Pecos County alone, companies have plans to invest $1 billion in large-scale solar energy farms. "Texas understands energy. Energy is a Texas thing," Hayhoe told me "We have the land we need to do this, as well as the technology and entrepreneurial spirit. I wish that the whole state could see that this is an opportunity for a better future."

Sept. 20--Dozens of Lubbock citizens joined climate strikes being held around the world Friday to demand action against what they consider to be one of the biggest threats to the future.
The Global Climate Strikes have brought together thousands of teenagers in the hopes of getting serious climate legislation enacted during the United Nations Climate Action Summit on Monday.
Fawwaz Shoukfeh, Noura Shoukfeh, Hairuo Yi, and Vaidehi Patel, all students at Lubbock High School, organized a strike for their fellow classmates during sixth period by walking out.
"Many of the people making laws now won't have to live with the effects of them in 40, 50, 60 years," said Fawwaz. "We will, and thus, we feel the need to voice our opinions so that the world of the future is suitable for the inhabitants of the future."
Organizers said the strike had more attendees than expected, as about 120 students joined Fawwaz and the others in the movement. Fawwaz said they are aware of the power they have as students and possibly future leaders, and they're hoping to inspire positive action from others in West Texas.
"There's this idea that not many people from Lubbock or the greater West Texas area believe in global warming or climate change," said Fawwaz. "The purpose of our strike is to tell people that we do believe in climate change and we do want to see the way we treat our Earth change."
Among the changes they would like to see are a decline of fossil fuels as a source of energy and more renewable and sustainable sources, legislation and resolutions that encourage businesses to be more climate-conscious, assistance in developing Third World countries without high carbon emission levels, and for the United States to lead the way to change.
"We'd love to see the United States use its diplomatic sway to push and lead other countries in the climate revolution," Fawwaz said.
Lubbock citizen Nathan Lewis organized another strike at the Tim Cole Memorial Park in the afternoon, saying he was inspired by Swedish teenager and climate activist Greta Thunberg and has spoken with others who are as concerned as he is.
"Everybody I've talked to is really concerned about climate change and how we need to move now and get politicians to listen," Lewis said. "Almost all climate scientists agree and have been saying it for 30-40 years, and we've just been dragging our feet, but it's now or never."
Ironically, the start of the strike was plagued by heavy rains that hit Lubbock mid-afternoon. Despite being drenched, supporters stood outside until the storm cleared.
"A lot of people stuck it out, which shows the dedication for this event," said Abe Behr, a strike participant. "I came out here to spread the word that climate change is here and it's happening, and it's solvable and affects everybody regardless of their political orientation, race, or religion."
Behr said the demonstrations around the world show how large a problem climate change is, but that he's hopeful since there has been so much enthusiasm with the Global Climate Strike.
"I wanted to show there are people in West Texas who care passionately about this issue, and we should because we're going to be hit harder than a lot of areas," said Behr. "We have a lot to lose here."

Political Chronology

Introduction

Tuvalu's primary concerns since independence have been economic. The country has very limited natural resources, and both colonialism and World War II served to diminish its limited resource base even further. Tuvalu expects to lose a major source of employment income in the near future, since many Tuvaluans work at the phosphate mines in neighboring Nauru, projected to reach final depletion around the turn of the 21st century.

Tuvalu has made compensation claims against the United Kingdom in regard to its dilapidated infrastructure and in particular for damage caused by the construction of Allied air bases during World War II. Indeed, in 1991, the government of Tuvalu announced that it was drafting a compensation claim regarding the terrible state of the country's finances at the time of independence.

Recently, Tuvalu and neighboring islands have begun discussing the possibility of uniting to address their economic, infrastructural and environmental concerns.

In 1996, the government decentralized, placing various departments on other islands, and delegating government responsibilities to island-based councils. Despite the country's ongoing dispute with the United Kingdom, Tuvaluans have consistently voted against motions to establish a republic, though reconstitution of Tuvalu's government along republican lines remains a possibility.

Political Developments from the 1990s to 2009

Tuvalu has seen repeated changes of government as a result of non-confidence motions in parliament. In 1995, Prime Minister Kamuta Latasi -- who was elected to head the government by parliament after indecisive general elections -- attempted to remove Tuvalu from the British Commonwealth and take steps toward initiating a republican system. In response, a coalition member named Puapua withdrew support, as did the deputy prime minister. Ultimately, Latasi lost a vote of confidence in parliament, and Paeniu succeeded him as prime minister in late 1996.

In general elections held in March 1998, Paeniu won enough support to remain prime minister. The new government initiated economic development plans and a constitutional reform plan to be implemented after dialogue with the general population. However, in a sequence of events reminiscent of what occurred a couple of years before, Paeniu's proposals provoked another vote of no confidence, putting him out of office in April 1999. The seven members of parliament who formed the majority toppling Paeniu ascribed their disapproval both to his slow progress in implementing government reforms and to concerns regarding Paeniu's alleged personal misconduct.

Parliament elected Ionatana Ionatana to replace Paeniu as prime minister. His plans include the development of the private sector, infrastructural improvements, and fulfillment of various programs launched by the previous government, notably the establishment of a national trust fund. 

Tuvalu suffered the worst disaster in its post-independence history in March 2000, a fire at a girls' dormitory that killed 18 young women. The dormitory had recently been constructed with assistance funds provided by the government of Japan.

In May 2000, Tuvalu officials finalized a contract with a United States-based Internet company set to pay US$4 million annually for 13 years. The contract confers use of Tuvalu's national domain name-the suffix ".tv" business interests forging the deal expect commercial attractiveness of the suffix to accelerate as interactive video applications become more widespread. The revenues derived from the usage of the suffix has been used to construct schools and to pave roads, which have customarily been made of crushed coral.

In December 2000, Prime Minister Ionatana Ionatana died of a heart attack, while reviewing a public function in the capital Funafuti. Ionatana had been prime minister for just under two years but had won international recognition for his deep concerns over climate change and the impact it is having on low-lying atoll nations such as Tuvalu. He had also won praise for developing Tuvalu's self-sufficiency through a project in which Tuvalu is gaining millions of dollars selling its dot.tv Internet suffix.. Ionatana, a former policeman and top civil servant, also spoke strongly in support of the rights of indigenous Fijians in Fiji following the May 19 coup by indigenous Fijian gunmen led by George Speight. Ionatana's deputy, Lagitupu Tuilimu, the deputy prime minister in Ionatana government, took charge as the acting prime minister upon Ionatana's death. Subsequent prime ministers included Koloa Talake in 2001 and Saufatu Sopoanga in 2002.

Ionatana was buried with full state honors at a funeral attended by several leaders of the region, who praised the departed leader for his contribution in building Tuvalu and also the role that he played in bringing to international attention issues like global warming and the threat posed to the island nations in the Pacific.

In January 2001, Tuvalu received a grant of US$8.6 million from Japan for the construction of an inter-island vessel. An embassy statement said the new passenger and cargo ship will supplement the existing services provided by the Tuvalu government's Nivaga II. The new ship will be assigned to providing regular services from Funafuti to Tuvalu's outer islands while the Nivaga II will be used primarily for services between Tuvalu and Fiji.

In 2002, then-Prime Minister Koloa Telake started legal action against the United Kingdom on the basis of an allegedly unfair division of assets between Tuvalu and Kiribati when the two were divided at the time of independence.

Also in 2002, elections were held in Tuvalu. In the parliamentary elections to the Fale I Fono or House of Assembly held on July 25, 2002, various independents won the 15 available seats. On August 2, 2002, an election was held within the parliament for the position of prime minister. In the election, Saufatu Sopoanga was elected prime minister with 8 votes in favor of his leadership, to Amasone Kilei's 7 votes.

In May 2003, by-elections were held and Prime Minister Sopoanga lost a one seat majority. Members of the opposition asked that the parliament be recalled so that a non-confidence vote could be heard. Several months later, however, the issue was unresolved. As such, opposition members were asking to see the Governor General in regard to the matter.

Throughout 2002 and well into 2003, Tuvalu, along with many other small Pacific island nation states, was faced with the disturbing environmental consequences of climate change. In recent academic studies, attention has been focused on the threat to island coastal areas as temperatures increase, polar ice caps melt and sea level rises as a result. The impact upon small island nations around the world is potentially dangerous. Until recently, less attention has been given to the more immediate effect, which is the matter of freshwater quality and availability.

At present, between 50 and 70 percent of the residents of Samoa have access to safe and drinkable water; in Kiribati and Tuvalu, the number drops to less than 45 percent. Other island nations, such as the Marshall Islands and Micronesia have had to deal with droughts and as rainwater or groundwater are their only freshwater resources, the effects on the population in the region is potentially dangerous. With global warming, droughts are predicted to increase along with the possibility of water shortages; the loss of freshwater resources could cause island nations such as Kiribati and Tuvalu to be uninhabitable.

Islands such as Tuvalu are under threat of being washed away if increases in sea level continue, as a consequence of global warming. Some studies suggest that these islands could cease to exist in 50 years as a result of climate change. The pollution caused by developed countries has become a major bone of contention in the view of small Pacific island states.  (Indeed, as recently as early 2004, locals noticed sea water bubbling up from the soil on the main atoll of Tuvalu in places normally used for flooding.)

In this regard, Tuvalu's former Prime Minister Koloa Talake, along with the leaders of Kiribati and Maldives, intended to launch a lawsuit and other legal measures against polluting countries. His successor, Saufatu Sopoanga, is expected to follow suit. Because of its close proximity, Australia is one of the first countries targeted for legal action, which will be decided in the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Because Australia accepts ICJ jurisdiction, it is considered to be a prime target in such lawsuits.

Meanwhile, New Zealand's government offered assistance in resettling islanders who were being affected by the dangerous rise in sea levels. As well, Australia's overseas aid program established a "land and sea-level" monitoring station in Tuvalu. 

The need for transnational policy on the matter is urgent, however, the countries of this region have very little leverage in the international sphere, especially since the United States and Australia have refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. Environmental issues of this sort are becoming the primary concern of the people and policy-makers in Pacific countries in 2003 and beyond.

Moving to the local political agenda, in August 2004, the country's prime minister, Safatu Sopoanga, suffered a huge setback when a parliament ousted his government in a no-confidence vote. 

With the country's Governor General Faimalaga Luka set to reconvene a swearing-in ceremony for the opposition's new government, several members of the outgoing government did not present themselves at the state house.  Instead,  Safatu Sopoanga announced his resignation from his position as prime minister, effectively forcing a by-election. 

The move was presumably intended to give Sopoanga's cadre more time to consolidate their base of political power base so they could retain leadership in the government.  To this end, they hoped to bring back to their side a member of parliament who had earlier crossed the floor. 

Meanwhile, as these events unfolded, Matia Toafa was made caretaker prime minister until the matter could be resolved. As head of government, Prime Minister Toafa led a review of the Constitution and promised to convene a referendum on whether the British monarch should be replaced as the Head of State -- in effect, moving the country toward the status of a republic.

But in 2006, attention turned to fresh elections, which went off in a free and fair manner on Aug. 3, 2006.  Final results showed that most incumbents had been defeated -- including the vast majority of the cabinet members.  Indeed, the prime minister was an exception, although he would not continue on in his capacity as head of government, as noted below.

The new parliament held its first session on Aug. 14, 2006.  Apisai Ielemia  was chosen to be head of government and Prime Minister. In his inaugural speech,  Prime Minister  Ielemia  made it clear that his policy agenda would include increased media freedom, good governance, transparency and accountability.

In 2007, Tuvalu's envoy to the United Nations, Afelee Pita,  addressed a special session of the United Nations Security Council dealing with the issue of global warming, climate change and the concomitant effect of the rise in sea level in small island nations.  

Two years later, in 2009,  the main issue facing Tuvalu -- as with many small island nations in the South Pacific --  continued to be the matter of geographic survival and its vulnerability to climate change. 

Climate change resulting in the rise in sea level, augmented by high tides, has resulted in beach erosion, soil poisoning,an inability to grow crops, street flooding including main thoroughfares being completely submerged, as well as threats to homes and livelihoods.  Of particular concern is the fact  that a rise in the  saltwater table could destroy deep rooted food crops such as coconut and taro.
Tuvalu is not much higher than sea level.  In 1978, a tide gauge was installed in Tuvalu by the University of Hawaii to measure the rise of sea level.  It measured a rise of 1.2 millimeters per year over 23 years.  This finding coincided with the research from the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC), which showed a  global mean estimated increase  of 1 to 2 millimeters per year over the 20th century.  The IPCC has said that there could be a 40 centimeter increase in sea level by the close of the 21st century -- a level that could have catastrophic effects for a country such as Tuvalu. 

Because Tuvalu is composed of  coral islands, land reclamation is a far more difficult endeavor than in other parts of the world.  Thus, the issue of global climate change has a particularly marked effect in Tuvalu and dominates this country's interests, agenda and policy initiatives.

This issue had other geopolitical implications when, in 2009, Taiwan extended an offer  of assistance to Tuvalu as regards the effects of climate change and the rise in sea level.  Tuvalu has been one of few countries to officially recognize Taiwan as a sovereign nation -- quite separate from Beijing rule. 

Also in  2009, Tuvalu made the decision to apply for membership in the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Special Report on United Nations Climate Change Summit in Copenhagen 

In December 2009, the United Nations Climate Change Summit opened  in the Danish capital of Copenhagen. The summit was scheduled to last from Dec. 7-18, 2009. Delegates from more than 190 countries were in attendance, and approximately 100 world leaders, including British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and United States President Barack Obama, were expected to participate. At issue was the matter of new reductions targets on greenhouse gas emissions by 2020.

On Dec. 9, 2009, four countries -- the United Kingdom, Australia, Mexico and Norway -- presented a document outlining ideas for raising and managing billions of dollars, which would be intended to help vulnerable countries dealing with the perils of climate change.  Described as a "green fund," the concept could potentially help small island states at risk because of the rise in sea level.  The "green fund" would fall under the rubric of  the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, for which developed countries have been committed to quantifying their emission reduction targets, and also to  providing financial and technical support to developing countries.

On Dec. 11, 2009, China demanded that developed and wealthy countries in Copenhagen should help deliver a real agreement on climate change by delivering on their promises to reduce carbon emissions and provide financial support for developing countries to adapt to global warming.  China's Vice Foreign Minister  also emphasized the fact that climate change was "a matter of survival" for developing countries, and accordingly, such countries need wealthier and more developed countries to accentuate not only their pledges of emissions reduction targets, but also their financial commitments under the aforementioned  United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  To that end, scientists and leaders of small island states in the Indian Ocean, the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, have highlighted  the existential threat posed by global warming and the concomitant rise in sea level.
China and India were joined by Brazil and South Africa in the crafting of a draft document calling for a new global climate treaty to be completed  by June 2010. Of concern has been the realization that there was insufficient time to find concurrence on a full legal treaty, which would leave countries only with a politically-binding text by the time the summit at Copenhagen closed. But Guyana's leader, President Bharrat Jagdeo, warned that the summit in Denmark would  be classified as a failure unless a binding document was agreed upon instead of just political consensus. He urged his cohorts to act with purpose saying, "Never before have science, economics, geo-strategic self-interest and politics intersected in such a way on an issue that impacts everyone on the planet."
Likewise, Tuvalu demanded that  legally binding agreements emerge from Copenhagen.  Its proposal was supported by many of the vulnerable countries, from small island states and sub-Saharan Africa, all of whom warned of  the catastrophic impact of climate change on their citizens.  Tuvalu also called for more aggressive action, such as  an amendment to the 1992 agreement, which would focus on sharp greenhouse gas emissions and the accepted rise in temperatures, due to the impact the rise in seas. The delegation from Kiribati joined the call by drawing attention to the fact that one village had to be abandoned due to waist-high water, and  more such effects were likely to follow.  Kiribati's Foreign Secretary, Tessie Lambourne, warned  that the people of Kiribati could well be faced with no homeland in the future  saying, "Nobody in this room would want to leave their homeland." But despite such impassioned pleas and irrespective of warnings from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  that the rise in sea level from melting polar ice caps would deleteriously affect low-lying atolls such as such as Tuvalu and Kiribati in the Pacific, and the Maldives in the Indian Ocean, the oil-giant Saudi Arabia was able to block this move.

By Dec. 12, 2009, details related to a draft document prepared by Michael Zammit Cutajar, the head of the Ad-hoc Working Group on Long-Term Cooperative Action, were released at the  Copenhagen climate conference.  Included in the document were calls for  countries to make major reductions in carbon emissions over the course of the next decade.  According to the Washington Post, industrialized countries were called on to make cuts of between 25 percent and 40 percent below 1990 levels -- reductions that were far more draconian than the United States was likely to accept.  As discussed above, President Obama had offered a provisional reduction target of 17 percent.  The wide gap between the released draft and the United States' actual stated position suggested there was much more negotiating in the offing if a binding agreement could be forged, despite the Obama administration's claims that it was seeking greater engagement on this issue.

The division between developed and developing countries in Copenhagen reached new heights on Dec. 14, 2009, when some of the poor and less developed countries launched a boycott at the summit. The move, which was spurred by African countries but backed by China and India,  appeared to be geared toward redirecting attention and primary responsibility to the wealthier and more industrialized countries.  The impasse was resolved after the  wealthier and more industrialized countries offered assurances that they did not intend on shirking from their commitments to reducing greenhouse gases.  As a result, the participating countries ceased the boycott.

Primer on parliamentary elections of 2010 in Tuvalu
A parliamentary election was scheduled to be held in Tuvalu on September 16, 2010. At stake were the 15 seats in the "Fale I Fono" or unicameral parliament, also called  the House of Assembly.  Typically, members of parliament are elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms, with all seats in the past held by independents.
Parliament was dissolved on August 13, 2010, ahead of the scheduled election date, and in preparation for the national elections.  Ahead of voting day, Prime Minister Apisai Ielemia led a caretaker government for one month.  Prime Minister Ielemia, who completed his first term in office, was hoping to stay on at the helm of government.
The outgoing Tuvalu government said that its priority for the future would be on the development of outer islands. Home Affairs Minister Willie Telavi noted that outer island development had been neglected in the past. Indeed, Tuvalu has been faced with significant geographical and financial challenges in delivering services to the eight atolls of Tuvalu.

Early election results indicated that  Prime Minister Apisai Ielemia was among ten sitting members of parliament re-elected to power.  Also re-elected to power were the incumbent ministers of finance, health and foreign affairs.

The prime minister would therefore seek to form a new coalition government before the end of the month.
But on September 22, 2010, five new members of parliament, who make up a full third of the legislative body, warned that the new government would not be reconstituted at the helm of the country. One such  member of parliament, Enele Sopoanga said, "There's no way that the former government will come back."  In an interview with PacNews, he continued, "There is going to be a change of government early next week and the horse trading for numbers have begun."  Whether or not the new government would include  Prime Minister Apisai Ielemia was yet to be determined.  Indeed, any new government would require the support of eight members of parliament.

Tuvalu Prime Minister Apisai Ielemia gained international cachet in 2009 when, in Copenhagen,  he lobbied for global action against the perils of climate change and the effects of the concomitant rise of sea levels on the lives of people living in small island nations.

On September 29, 2010, in the aftermath of the aforementioned elections and in an internal vote in parliament, it was former Prime Minister Matia Toafa and not Aposai Ielemia who was elected as the new head of government.  It was a reversal of fortune of sorts for the two politicians since Toafa had once lost his seat to Ielemia.  Toafa garnered nine votes in his favor, including five votes from the newly-elected members of parliament, who had signaled that they were in favor of a change in government.

Toafa was inaugurated into office right after the internal parliamentary vote by Governor General Iakopa Italeli Taeia.

In his first public interview with Radio Tuvalu, the new prime minister called on his cabinet to work on behalf of the people of Tuvalu. 

Meanwhile, all five of the new members of parliament were accorded key cabinet positions, including the portfolios for finance, which went to newcomer, Monise Laafai,  and health, which went to journalist, Sauoa Maani.  As well, former diplomat and climate change negotiator, Enele Sopoanga, was given the portfolio for foreign affairs, environment and labor.  All eight cabinet ministers were sworn into office following Prime Minister Toafa's inauguration.

Recent Developments

On Dec. 22, 2010, Tuvalu's parliament was dissolved following a no-confidence vote against Prime Minister Maatia Toafa.  The confidence motion passed successfully when one cabinet minister -- Willy Telavi -- crossed the floor to vote in favor of the motion.  There appeared to be a financial motivation for the vote with members of parliament concerned about the forthcoming budget and allocations for island development, medical treatment costs, and salaries of state workers.  Soon thereafter, nominations were taking place for possible successors to Toafa for the job of head of government.  To that end, the cross-over voter, Willy Telavi, was ultimately elected to take on the role of head of government.  Telavi,  a former police commissioner who held the post of Minister of Home Affairs in the cabinet of Prime Minister Toafa,  was elected on Dec. 24, 2010, defeating Foreign Affairs and Environment Minister Eneke Sopoaga  by a razor thin 8-7 vote.
Telavi's government was at risk more than two years later when at the start of July 2013, Tuvalu's opposition requested that the country's governor general use his special powers to reconvene parliament.  At issue was the result of a by-election that resulted in victory for an opposition candidate for a vacant seat in parliament.  That outcome essentially meant that the government lost its narrow parliamentary majority.  As such, the opposition wanted to have the parliamentary distribution of seats to be confirmed, potentially setting the scene for a no-confidence vote, which could oust the sitting government from power.  For his part, Tuvalu Prime Minister Willy Tevali has not been in a hurry to reconvene parliament given the fact that the government no longer commanded a parliamentary majority.  See below for details.

Parliamentary session in Tuvalu results in ousting of government and election of new PM

An important parliamentary session loomed ahead in Tuvalu, which was expected to decide the fate of the government of Prime Minister Willy Telavi.

At issue was a victory for the opposition in a by-election for a seat on Nukufetau Island  held in mid-June 2013, which offered the opposition the position to command a parliamentary majority.  Now the composition in parliament gave the government seven seats and the opposition eight seats.  Assuming the members of the parliament voted in lockstep with their blocs, such a distribution of parliamentary seats would set the path in motion to bring down the government of Prime Minister Willy Tevali. Anxious to test the possibility that it could form a new government, the opposition has been angling for a new parliamentary session in which it could bring forth a confidence vote.

At the start of July 2013, Tuvalu's governor general, Sir Lakoba Italeli, acquiesced to the calls from the opposition and ordered parliament to sit in session on July 30, 2013. It would be the first sitting of parliament since late December 2012 when the member of parliament passed a budget.  This session at the end of July 2013 would predictably include the introduction of a no-confidence motion by the opposition against the Tevali government.

It should be noted that Tuvalu's political scene has been marked by stalemate since late 2012 with the only productive bit of business done at the time was the passage of the budget, as noted above. Now, according to Opposition Spokesperson Taukalina Finikaso, it was way past time to shift the dynamics. As noted by Finikaso, "We have been in this uncertainty for quite a long period. It is seven months now and we cannot continue on like this without parliament meeting and without the nation knowing what is happening. So we think it is a very good decision by the governor general and I think he has done it in the spirit of the constitution and also the democratic nation of Tuvalu."

Now, with the parliamentary session looming ahead and a no-confidence vote in the offing, the opposition was expressing confidence that it was united and had the seats to command a majority.  Accordingly, Opposition Spokesperson  Finikaso believed that voting on the confidence measure would, therefore,  go its way.  Indeed, among the opposition ranks, there were high hopes that the vote would result in the toppling of the government and the formation of a new government. But the prime minister was equally confident that he had the support to defeat the no confidence motion, thanks to the support of a couple of cross-over votes,  and he would ultimately hold sway in command of the government.  Indeed, Prime Minister  Willy Telavi's stance appeared to be that of a man spoiling for a fight he was sure to win.  It was to be seen which side would prove to be correct.

Politically, the advantage seemed to be with the opposition at the start of August 2013. First, the government's faction in parliament was short at least one vote due to the death of Finance Minister Lotoala Metia in December 2012. Second, ill health of Education Minister Falesa Pitoi meant that the government would be short an additional member.  Third, the  pro-government faction in parliament was further diminished when Health Minister Taom Tanukale resigned from parliament.  But things moved in a decidedly dismal direction for those in power when Prime MInister Telavi's government lost a motion to dissolve parliament before the anticipated  vote of no confidence could be taken against them.

The scene in parliament turned dramatic when the opposition advanced its no-confidence vote in the Telavi government only to have Tuvalu's Speaker of Parliament refuse the motion and announced an adjournment.  Governor General Iakopa Italeli Taeia entered the fray and called for the parliament to meet and resume activity. This move sparked a  battle of wills between the prime minister and the governor general when Telavi said that he was removing Governor General Iakopa Italeli Taeia from his post as the head of state. Hours later,  however, Italeli said he was removing Prime Minister Telavi and his cabinet from office and appointing the opposition leader, Enele Sopoanga, as a caretaker prime minister. The scenario  had all the makings of a constitutional crisis.  But regardless of Telavi's claim on legitimacy, the fact of the matter was that the numbers in parliament favored the parliament.

Ultimately on Aug. 2, 2013, a majority of members of parliament supported the no-confidence motion and officially brought down Telavi's government.  Later in the parliamentary session,  Enele Sopoaga --  the opposition leader -- was elected to serve as the new prime minister.

Prime Minister Sopoanga soon unveiled his cabinet and the new government was sworn into power by the governor general, Sir Iakoba Italeli in Funafuti.  Included in the government was the deputy premier, Vete Sakaio, who would also be responsible for public utilities.  Former diplomat, Finikaso Taukelina, a former diplomat,  who would become the new minister for foreign affairs. Home Affairs, which was normally part of the prime minister's portfolio, would become a separate government ministry with Namoliku Sualiki at the helm. The health portfolio and the education portfolio were merged under one ministry to be headed by Fauoa Maani. The portfolio for finance and economic development would be held by Maatia Toafa, a former prime minister.  Meanwhile,  the portfolio for communication and transport, as well as the portfolio for natural resources, would be held by  Monisa Laafai and Elisala Pita respectively.

Note: It should be noted that irrespective of the inauguration of the new Tuvalu government, its legitimacy remained a matter of debate.  There was a court decision pending over the actions taken by both the governor general and the former prime minister, leading up to the installation of the new government.
Elections Note:

Parliamentary elections were set to be held on March 19, 2015, in Tuvalu; they were delayed (as discussed below) due to Cyclone Pam and ultimately held on March 31, 2015.  At stake was the composition of the unicameral parliament, also called the House of Assembly or "Fale I Fono."  In this body, the seats are occupied by members who are elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms.  There are no functional parties vying for control of the legislative chamber; instead, all members of parliament are political independents.

From 2010 to 2015, Tuvalu has seen a parade of prime ministers as rivalries, confidence motions, and political machinations have brought down one government after the other.  Since 2013, Enele Sopoaga has  served as the caretaker prime minister.  The Sopoaga government increased its majority in parliament over the course of 2014 as a result of two by-elections.  It was to be seen if the Sopoaga government  would win a mandate in the 2015 parliamentary contest.

But the answer to the question of who would lead the new Tuvalu government was left unanswered due to a weather crisis.  Cyclone Pam hit the islands of the south Pacific hard, with Tuvalu being among those particularly hard-hit. Indeed, Tuvalu's election was postponed due to the damage wrought by Cyclone Pam, which left the country in dire need of fresh water supplies and other forms of emergency assistance.

Voters finally went to the polls on March 31, 2015, and ultimately, most of the members of parliament were returned to power.  This result set the stage for  the government of Enele Sopoaga to return to power.  To that end, on April 10, 2015, it was announced officially that  Sopoaga was returned to power as Tuvalu's prime minister. In parliament he had a clear majority, given the support of 11 out of the 15 allied elected members of parliament.

Editor's Update:

Note that Tuvalu's election, scheduled to be held on March 19, 2015 as noted above,  was postponed due to the damage wrought by Cyclone Pam.  That cyclone hit the islands of the Pacific hard and  left Tuvalu in dire need of fresh water supplies and other forms of emergency assistance. 

Election of 2019:
Parliamentary elections were set to be held on Sept. 9, 2019 in Tuvalu.  At stake was the composition of the unicameral parliament, also called the House of Assembly or "Fale I Fono."  In this body, there are 16 seats occupied by members who are elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms.  There are no functional parties vying for control of the legislative chamber; instead, all members of parliament are political independents. 

Following these elections, once the composition of the House of Assembly was decided, an internal vote within the legislative chamber was carried out to determine the new head of government.  Kausea Natano won 10 of the 16 votes at stake and was inaugurated as the new prime minister on Sept. 19, 2019.

Environmental Note:

Small island countries announce plan to sue multinational fossil fuel corporations for their role in climate change --

In mid-2015, six small island nation states -- Vanuatu, Kiribati, Tuvalu, Fiji, Solomon Islands and  Philippines -- released a manifesto on climate change.  Dubbed the  "People's Declaration for Climate Justice,"  the declaration announced a plan to sue large multinational fossil fuel corporations, which they blamed for  carbon pollution,  the degradation to their ecosystems, and the other deleterious effects of climate change.

The highlights of the manifesto read as follows:  "We, the people of Vanuatu, Kiribati, Tuvalu, Fiji, Solomon Islands and the Philippines continue to experience the impacts of climate change - the single biggest human rights, environmental and humanitarian crisis of our time As the people most acutely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, we will not let the big polluters decide and assign our fate We commit to holding those most responsible for climate change accountable. By doing so, we send a message of hope that the people and not the polluters are in charge of humanity's destiny. "  In truth, the effort to sue the world's largest fossil fuel corporations would not be a simple endeavor and  the plaintiff nation states might not even see their day in court; however, small island countries were not willing to silently accept the pressing environmental threat to their existence without seeking accountability.

Editor's Entry on Environmental Policy:

Small island nations across the world are  vulnerable to the threats posed by global warming and cimate change, derived from carbon emissions, and resulting in the rise in sea level.  Political policy in the country is often connected to ecological issues, which have over time morphed into an existential crisis of sorts.

December 2012 saw climate talks in the Qatari city of Doha.  There, representatives from countries across the world gathered to discuss the fate of the Kyoto Protocol, which seeks to minimize greenhouse gas emissions.  The summit yielded results with  decisions made (1) to extend the Kyoto Protocol until 2020, and (2) for wealthier countries to compensate poorer countries for the losses and damage incurred as a result of climate change.

There was, in fact, little progress made on the central issue of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  Had those emissions been reduced, there would have been less of a need to financially deal with the devastation caused by climate change.  One interpretation was that the global community was accepting the fact that industrialization was contributing to global warming, which had deleterious effects on the polar ice caps  and concomitantly on the rise of sea level, with devastating effects for small island nations. Thus, wealthier countries were willing to pay around $10 billion a year through 2020, effectively in "damages," to the poor countries that could be viewed as the "collateral damage" of industrial progress.  But damages today could potentially be destruction tomorrow, leaving in place the existential challenges and burdens to be born by some of the world's smallest and least wealthy island countries.

Perhaps not surprisingly, the  representative for the small island nation states at the Doha summit responded with ire, characterizing the lack of progress on reducing emissions as follows: "We see the package before us as deeply deficient in mitigation (carbon cuts) and finance. It's likely to lock us on the trajectory to a 3,4,5C rise in global temperatures, even though we agreed to keep the global average temperature rise of 1.5C to ensure survival of all islands. There is no new finance (for adapting to climate change and getting clean energy) -- only promises that something might materialize in the future. Those who are obstructive need to talk not about how their people will live, but whether our people will live."

Indeed, in most small island countries not just in the Pacific, but also the Caribbean and Indian Ocean, ecological concerns and the climate crisis have been dominant themes with dire life and death consequences looming in the background for their people.  Small island nations in these region  are already at risk from the rise of sea-level, tropical cyclones, floods.  But  their very livelihoods of fishing and subsistence farming are also at risk as a result of ecological and environmental changes.  Of particular concern is the matter of  ocean acidification, which destroys  reefs and decimates fish and shellfish populations that provide protein for inhabitants.  At the same time, increasingly high storm surges can wipe out  coastlines, and even  entire villages, while

contaminating water supplies.  Accordingly, the very existence of islands are at severe risk of being obliterated from the map.  Yet even with the existential threat of being wiped off the map in the offing, the international community has been either slow or restrictive in its efforts to deal with global warming, climate change, economic and ecological damage, as well as the emerging global challenge of environmental refugees.

A 2012  report from the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the Pacific Regional Environment Program underlined the concerns of small island nations and their people as it concluded that the livelihoods of approximately 10 million people in Pacific island communities were increasingly vulnerable to climate change. In fact, low-lying islands in that region  would likely confront  losses of up to 18 percent of gross domestic product due to climate change, according to the report. The report covers 21 countries and territories, including Fiji, Kiribati,  Samoa and Tonga, and recommended  environmental legislation intended to deal with the climate crisis facing the small island countries particularly. As noted by David Sheppard, the director general of the Pacific Regional Environment Program that co-sponsored this study: "The findings... emphasize the need more than ever to raise the bar through collective actions that address the region's environmental needs at all levels."

Special Report

COP 21 summit in Paris ends with historic agreement to tackle climate change; rare international consensus formed on environmental crisis facing the planet --

In mid-December 2015, the highly-anticipated United Nations climate conference of parties (COP) in Paris, France, ended with a historic agreement.  In fact, it would very likely be understood as the most significant international agreement signed by all the recognized countries of the world since the Cold War.  Accordingly, the Paris Agreement was being distinguished as the first multilateral pact that would compel all countries across the world to cut its carbon emissions -- one of the major causes of increasing greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to global warming, and its deleterious effects ranging from the dangerous rise in sea level to catastrophic climate change.

The accord, which was dubbed to be the "Paris Agreement," was the work of rigorous diplomacy and fervent environmental advocacy, and it aimed to address the climate change crisis facing the planet.  As many as 195  countries were represented in the negotiations that led to the landmark climate deal.  Indeed, it was only after  weeks of passionate debate that  international concurrence was reached in addressing the environmental challenges confronting the world, with particular attention to moving beyond fossil fuels and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The success of the COP 21 summit in Paris and the emergence of the landmark Paris Agreement was, to some extent, attributed to the efforts of France's  Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius who presided over the negotiations.  The French foreign minister's experience and credentials as a seasoned diplomat and respected statesman paid dividends.  He skillfully guided the delegates from almost 200 countries and interest groups along the negotiations process, with ostensibly productive results and a reasonably robust deal to show for it.

On Dec. 12, 2015, French Foreign Minister Fabius officially adopted the agreement, declaring: "I now invite the COP to adopt the decision entitled Paris Agreement outlined in the document.  Looking out to the room I see that the reaction is positive, I see no objections. The Paris agreement is adopted."  Once Foreign Minister Fabius' gavel was struck, symbolically inaugurating the Paris Agreement into force, the COP delegate rushed to their feet with loud and bouyant cheers as well as thunderous applause.

In general, the Paris Agreement was being hailed as a victory for enviromental activists and a triumph for international diplomats, while at the same time being understood as simply an initial -- and imperfect -- move in the direction of a sustainable future.

China's chief negotiator, Xie Zhenhua, issued this  message, saying that while the accord was not ideal,  it should "not prevent us from marching historical steps forward."

United States President  Barack Obama lauded the deal as both "ambitious" and "historic,"  and the work of strenuous multilateral negotiations as he declared, "Together, we've shown what's possible when the world stands as one."  The United States leader acknowledged that the accord  was not "perfect," but he reminded the critics that it was "the best chance to save the one planet we have. "

Former United States Vice President Al Gore, one of the world's most well known environmental advocates, issued a lengthy statement on the accompishments ensconced in the Paris Agreement.  He highlighted the fact that the Paris Agreement was a first step towards a future with a reduced carbon footprint on Planet Earth as he said,  "The components of this agreement -- including a strong review mechanism to enhance existing commitments and a long-term goal to eliminate global-warming pollution this century -- are essential to unlocking the necessary investments in our future. No agreement is perfect, and this one must be strengthened over time, but groups across every sector of society will now begin to reduce dangerous carbon pollution through the framework of this agreement."

The central provisions of the Paris Agreement included the following items:

- Greenhouse gas emissions should peak as quickly as possible, with a move towards balancing energy sources, and ultimately the decrease of  greenhouse gases in the second half of this century
- Global temperature increase would be limited to 1.5 degrees Centigrade  above pre-industrial levels and would be held "well below" the  two degrees Centigrade threshold
-  Progress on these goals would be reviewed  every five years beginning in 2020 with new  greenhouse gas reduction targets issued every five years
- $100 billion would be expended each year in climate finance for developing countries to move forward with green technologies, with further climate financing to be advanced in the years beyond

It should be noted that there both  legally binding and voluntary elements contained within the Paris Agreement. Specifically, the  submission of an emissions reduction target and the regular review of that goal would be legally mandatory for all countries.  Stated differently, there would be a system in place by which  experts would be able to track the carbon-cutting progress of each country.  At the same time, the specific targets to be set by countries would be determined at the discretion of the countries, and would not be binding.  While there was some criticism over this non-binding element, the fact of the matter was that the imposition of emissions targets was believed to be a major factor in the failure of climate change talks in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 2009. 

In 2015, the talks faced challenges as several countries, such as China and India, objected to conditions that would stymie economic and development. In order to avoid that kind of landmine, a system Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) was developed and formed the basis of the accord. As such, the Paris Agreement would, in fact,  facilitate economic growth and development, as well as technological progress, but with the goal of long-term ecological sustainability based on low carbon  sources.  In fact, the agreement heralded as "the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel era."  As noted by Nick Mabey, the head of the climate diplomacy organization E3G, said, "Paris means governments will go further and faster to tackle climate change than ever before.  The transition to a low carbon economy is now unstoppable, ensuring the end of the fossil fuel age."

A particular sticking point in the agreement was the $100 billion earmarked for  climate financing for developing countries to transition from traditional fossil fuels to green energy technologies and a low carbon future.  In 2014, a report by the  International Energy Agency indicated that the cost of that transition would actually be around $44 trillion by the mid-century -- an amount that would render the $100 billion being promised to be a drop in the proverbial bucket.  However, the general expectation was that the Republican-controlled Senate in the United States, which would have to ratify the deal in that country, was not interested in contributing significant funds for the cause of climate change. 

A key strength of the Paris Agreement was the ubiquitous application of measures to all countries.  Of note was the frequently utilized concept of "flexibility" with regard to the Paris Agreement.  Specifically,  the varying capacities of the various countries in meeting their obligations would be anticipated and accorded flexibility.  This aspect presented something of a departure from the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which drew a sharp distinction between developed and developing countries, and mandated a different set of obligations for those categories of countries.  Thus, under Kyoto, China and India were not held to the same standards as the United States and European countries.

In the Paris Agreement, there would be commitments from all countries across the globe.

Another notable strength of the Paris Agreement was the fact that the countries of the world were finally able to reach consensus on the vital necessity to limit global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Centrigrade.  Ahead of the global consensus on the deal, and as controversy continued to surface over the targeted global temperature limits, the leaders of island countries were sounding the alarm about the melting of the Polar ice caps and the associated rise in seal level.  Prime Minister

Enele Sopoaga of Tuvalu issued this dismal reminder: "Tuvalu's future  is already bleak and any further temperature increase will spell the total demise of Tuvalu. No leader in this room carries such a level of worry and responsibility. Just imagine you are in my shoes, what would you do?"  It was thus something of a victory for environmental advocates that the countries of the world could find cnsensus on the lower number -- 1.5 degrees rather than 2 degrees.

A  significant weak point with regard to the Paris deal was a "loss and damage" provision, which anticipates that even with all the new undertakings intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and move to a low carbon future, there would nonetheless be unavoidable climate change consequences.  Those consequences ranged from the loss of arable land for farmers as well as soil erosion and contamination of potable water by sea water, to the decimation of territory in coastal zones and on small islands, due to the rise in sea level, with entire small island countries being rendered entirely uninhabitable.  The reality was that peoples' homes across the world would be destroyed along with their way of life.

With that latter catastrophic effect being a clear and present danger for small island countries, the  Association of Small Island States (AOSIS) demanded that the developed world acknowledge its responsibility for this irreversible damage..

Despite the fact that greenhouse gas emissions and the ensuing plague of global warming was, indeed, the consequence of development in the West (the United States and Europe) and the large power house countries, such as Russia, China and India,  there was no appetite by those countries to sign on to unlimited liability.  Under the Paris Agreement,  there was a call for  research  on insurance mechanisms that would address loss and damage issues, with recommendations to come in the future.

The call for research was being regarded as an evasion of sorts and constituted the weakest aspect of the Paris Agreement.  Not surprisingly, a coalition of small island nations demanded a "Marshall Plan" for the Pacific.  Borrowing the term "Marshall Plan" from the post-World War II reconstruction effort, the coalition of Pacific island nation, which included Kiribati, Tuvalu, Fiji, and the Marshall Islands, called for an initiative that would include investment in renewable energy and shoreline protection,  cultural preservation, economic assistance for economies in transition, and a plan for migration and resettlement for these countries as they confront the catastrophic effects of the melting of the Polar ice caps and the concomitant rise in sea level.  The precise contours of the initiative remained unknown, unspecified, and a mere exercise in theory at the time of writing.  Yet such an initiative would, at some point, have to be addressed, given the realities of climate change and the slow motion calamity unfolding each day for low-lying island nations across the world.

As noted by Vice President Greg Stone of  Conservation International, who also functions as  an adviser to the government of Kiribati, "Imagine living in a place where you know it's going to go away someday, but you don't know what day that wave's going to come over and wash your home away."  He added, "It's a disaster we know is going to happen."

Meanwhile, the intervening years promised to be filled with hardship for small island nations, such as Kiribati.  Stone explained, "For every inch of sea-level rise, these islands lose 10 feet of their freshwater table to saltwater intrusion," Stone explained. "So it's not just about the day the water finally goes over the island; it's also about the day that there's just not enough water left and everyone has to move off the island."  Presaging the future for island nations that could face submersion, Stone said, "If you look ahead 50 years, a country like Kiribati could become the first aqueous nation. possibility of migration. That is, they own this big patch of ocean, and they administer it from elsewhere."

Foreign Minister Minister Tony Debrum of the Marshall Islands emerged as the champion advocating on behalf of small island nation states and a loose coalition of concerned countries from the Pacific to the Caribbean, but with support from the United States.  He addressed the comprehensive concerns of small island nations regarding the weaknesses of the deal, while simultaneously making clear that the Paris Agreement signified hope for the countries most at risk.  In a formal statement, Debrum declared: "We have made history today. Emissions targets are still way off track, but this agreement has the tools to ramp up ambition, and brings a spirit of hope that we can rise to this challenge. I can go back home to my people and say we now have a pathway to survival."  Debrum highlighted the imperatives of Pacific island nations, saying, "Our High Ambition Coalition was the lightning rod we needed to lift our sights and expectations for a strong agreement here in Paris. We were joined by countries representing more than half the world. We said loud and clear that a bare-bones, minimalist agreement would not fly. We instead demanded an agreement to mark a turning point in history, and the beginning of our journey to the post-carbon era."

Debrum of the Marshall Islands espoused the quintessential synopsis of the accord and its effects for those most likely to be affected by climate change as he noted, "Climate change won't stop overnight, and my country is not out of the firing line just yet, but today we all feel a little safer."
Special Note Affecting Pacific Island Nations:
The impact of climate change as grounds for asylum --

In March 2018, New Zealand became the first country in the world to recognize the deleterious impact of climate change as grounds for asylum.  

Neighboring island nation states in the Pacific Ocean were experiencing the effects of climate change as an existential crisis.  The rise of sea level, the erosion of coastlines, and loss of potable water and soil needed for survival was impacting the viability of Pacific countries such as the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Kiribati, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, Palau, among others.  Some countries were expected to be wiped off the map by the end of the century, generating entire nations of environmental refugees. 

Environmental refugees do not enjoy protections under international law as  the 1951 Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees protects persons fleeing persecution, from war or violence and not environmental crisis.  Moreover, the people of environmentally affected countries often do not want to be classified as refugees anyway. 
Former President Anote Tong of Kiribati has emphasized that the people of his country, quite likely to be rendered geographically homeless within decades, wanted to "migrate with dignity."

Against this backdrop,  New Zealand -- led by its Labour Party government, backed by the Green Party --  became the first country in the world to recognize the deleterious impact of climate change as grounds for asylum.  Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced plans to create a special visa for Pacific Islanders rendered homeless and forced to relocate because of the rise of sea level.  The program would begin in a limited manner - with only 100 visas offered annually.  However, it would serve as a precedent of sorts, setting an example for other countries to follow and also offer assistance. 

As noted by former Prime Minister Helen Clark via Twitter, New Zealand already had in place "significant migrant quotas for citizens of its Pacific neighbours" as part of its good neighbor policy. The new visa program would build upon this foundation. 

At the international level, the move by New Zealand could encourage assistance by other countries irrespective of legal recognition of refugee status by the United nations, Moreover,  it is an extension of the

"Protection Agenda" which 109 countries endorsed in 2015, and which seeks to organize resources to help the people affected by catastrophic effects of climate change. 
Editor's Entry on Environmental Policy: 

The low-lying Pacific island nations of the world, including Kiribati, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, Fiji, among others, are  vulnerable to the threats posed by global warming and cimate change, derived from carbon emissions, and resulting in the rise in sea level.  Other island nations in the Caribbean, as well as poor countries with coastal zones, were also at particular risk of suffering the deleterious effects of climate change.

Political policy in these countries are often connected to ecological issues, which have over time morphed into an existential crisis of sorts.  Indeed,  ecological concerns and the climate crisis have  also been dominant themes with life and death consequences for the people of island nations in the Pacific.  Indeed, the very livelihoods of fishing and subsistence farming remain at risk as a result of ecological and environmental changes.

Yet even so, these countries are threatened by increasingly high storm surges, which could wipe out entire villages and contaminate water supplies.  Moreover, because these are low lying island nations, the sustained rise in sea level can potentially lead to the terrain of these countries being unihabitable at best, and submerged at worst.  Stated in plain terms, these countries are at severe risk of being obliterated from the map and their plight illuminates the emerging global challenge of environmental refugees.  In these manifold senses, climate change is the existential crisis of the contemporary era.

Since the time of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, there have been efforts aimed at extending the life of that agreement, with an eye on minimizing greenhouse gas emissions, and thus minimizing the effects of climate change.  Those endeavors have largely ended in failure, as exemplified by the unsuccessful Copenhagen talks in 2009 and the fruitless Doha talks in 2012 respectively.  The success of the COP 21 talks in France, with the adoption of the landmark Paris Agreement in 2015, was regarded as the first glimmer of hope.  Not only did the Paris Agreement signify the triumph of international diplomacy and global consensus, but it also marked the start of the end of the fossil fuel era, with the path forward toward a low carbon future reliant on greener technologies.  Most crucially, the Paris Agreement stood as the first significant response in recent times to the central challenge of climate change and its quotidian effects on the lives of real human beings across the world. 

Pandemic Note
The coronavirus pandemic in 2020 has severely affected the economies of most countries of the world. Both poor and middle class households have been affected, with devastating impact most obvously on countries with tourism and service sectors.
The remote location of island countries of the Pacific has provided some insulation from the worst of the  global COVID-19 pandemic. By closing borders early into the pandemic and implementing strict quarantine protocols, Pacific Islands have seen the lowest incidences of coronavirus. That being said, the small and sometimes inadequate health care systems in these countries leave them at grave risk should community outbreaks occur.
Adding to the challenges facing Pacific Islands countries is the reality that they are most subject to devastating climate change disasters.  As with their vulnerabilities to the global pandemic, they are likewise vulnerable to the real and present danger of climate change.
At the broader economic level, most of these small island nations have limited natural resources, associated limited economies, significant poverty, and are located far from major markets. They  are accordingly deleteriously affected by external shocks to the global marketplace.  As the old adage goes in regard to international economic downturns, when the developed world gets a cold, the developing world gets pneumonia.
Accordingly, the islands of the Pacific will see major challenges -- not just economic, but existential -- from 2020 and onward.

BIARRITZ, France (AP)  2019--BIARRITZ, France (AP) -- The Latest on President Donald Trump at the Group of Seven summit in France (all times local):
6:05 p.m.President Donald Trump has dismissed concerns about climate change at a world leaders' summit in France, saying he's "not going to lose" America's wealth "on dreams" and "windmills."Trump was asked during a press conference marking the end of the Group of Seven gathering what the world should be doing to address climate change. He skipped a session on the topic earlier Monday.Trump answered by saying that the U.S. "has tremendous wealth" ''under its feet" and that he's not going to lose it "on dreams, on windmills."Trump also claims to be "an environmentalist" despite his past statements and says he thinks he knows "more about the environment than most people."Trump has expressed skepticism about climate science in the past, including falsely describing it as a "hoax" created by the Chinese to hurt the U.S. economy.5:55 p.m.President Donald Trump says it's better to have Russia "in the tent" rather than "outside the tent" of the group of advanced industrialized economies.Speaking Monday at the Group of Seven summit in France, Trump said that he's inclined to invite Russia to next year's summit in the United States and that it's being discussed. 
Russia was kicked out of the group after it annexed Crimea in 2014.Trump says some G-7 countries want Russia invited back but others are opposed. Trump didn't single out any nation but noted Germany buys energy from Russia while the U.S. helps defend Europe from Moscow aggression.European Union officials have said that Russia isn't welcome because it doesn't adhere to democratic principles.5:40 p.m.President Donald Trump says he is not looking "at this moment" to impose tariffs on automobiles imported from Japan.The U.S. and Japan say they are nearing a new trade agreement that would include more agricultural exports to Japan, such as beef and pork.Trump is making clear that imposing auto tariffs in the name of national security is an option at a later date but adds "we're not looking at that. We just want to be treated fairly."Trump was wrapping up his trip to this year's Group of Seven summit in France on Monday and addressed the prospect of auto tariffs in a press conference.Trump says Japan has run a large trade surplus with the U.S. and claims new trade deals will help transform the economy, though the trade tensions have spooked financial markets.5:35 p.m.President Donald Trump insists he has no interest in profiting from next year's Group of Seven summit even as he talks up his private Miami-area golf course as a potential site.Trump praised Trump National Doral at a televised press conference in France on Monday, touting its acreage, its proximity to the airport, its restaurants and what he called its "magnificent" bungalows with "magnificent views."Still, he claims he wouldn't "make any money" off the summit even though he still profits from his clubs.Trump also insists, without evidence, that the presidency will end up costing him $3 billion to $5 billion, even though that number seems impossibly high.Trump said earlier Monday that Doral would be the likely venue for next year's summit, which the U.S. is hosting. He says, "I think having it in Miami is fantastic."5:25 p.m.President Donald Trump says that he's open to meeting with Iran to resolve the nuclear standoff but that if Iran doesn't agree to being a "good player" it will be met with "very violent force."French President Emmanuel Macron (eh-mahn-yoo-EHL' mah-KROHN') said Monday at the Group of Seven summit in France that he hopes Trump and the Iranian president will meet in the coming weeks. Macron says G-7 leaders agreed Iran needs to meet its nuclear obligations but there was a hope for a diplomatic breakthrough in the conflict that has grown since the U.S. left the 2015 nuclear accord.Trump says progress can be made, although it "may not be immediately."Macron says he will work with nations still in the deal to facilitate progress. He says there is talk of negotiating a new agreement.5:05 p.m.President Donald Trump says China has taken a "hard hit" in recent months and he believes that Chinese leaders are sincere about wanting to reach a trade deal.Trump is concluding his trip to this year's Group of Seven summit in France on Monday by participating in a press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron.Macron says the trade dispute between the U.S and China creates economic uncertainty and the quicker an agreement is reached the sooner economic uncertainty will dissipate.Trump claims that China is serious about making a trade deal after his actions last week when he raised retaliatory tariffs and ordered American companies to consider alternatives to doing business there.Leading U.S. business groups criticized the escalation and the move sent U.S. stock markets stumbling.5 p.m.President Donald Trump is papering over the differences that were on full display in France as he concludes his participation in the Group of Seven global summit.Trump tells reporters at a joint press conference with French President Emanuel Macron that the summit was "truly successful" and that "tremendous unity" was on display.He says that "Nobody wanted to leave" the final discussion and says, "It really was the G-7."Fissures between the U.S. and six of the world's other advanced economies were apparent, however, on issues including trade policy, Russia, Iran and climate change during the talks at a picturesque French beach resort. That includes a push to invite Russia back into the group and skipping a session on climate with the other world leaders.2 p.m.President Donald Trump says U.S. talks with the Taliban are on "no timeline" for reaching a resolution to the nearly 18-year-old war, which has claimed more than 2,400 Americans.Trump told reporters Monday at the Group of Seven summit in France that the U.S. is talking with the Taliban, the Afghan government and others, but is in "no rush" and has "no timeline" for the discussions.The U.S. and the Taliban appear to be closing in on an agreement under which U.S. forces would withdraw in exchange for guarantees that Afghanistan would not become a haven for other terrorist groups.The U.S. is trying to get the Taliban to agree to stop fighting and sit down with the Kabul government, but violence has continued with large attacks in the capital1:45 p.m.President Donald Trump has missed a discussion on climate with other world leaders at the Group of Seven summit in France.Trump was scheduled to attend Monday's session on climate, biodiversity and oceans, but his chair was empty during a portion of the meeting reporters were allowed to witness.French President Emmanuel Macron says that while Trump didn't attend, his aides were there.The president started the morning behind schedule. His meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel was delayed about two hours.He then met with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, where he was asked about attending the climate session.He said it would be his next stop and that he wants clean air and water.Trump is a climate change skeptic who once had claimed it's a hoax that was invented by the Chinese.1:30 p.m.President Donald Trump says he thinks Pakistan and India will be able to work out a resolution over the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir on their own without his help.In July, India rejected Trump's offer to mediate and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi again told reporters at the Group of Seven summit in France that Kashmir is a bilateral issue. India has long refused outside attempts to resolve the conflict while Pakistan has sought international help.Trump said Monday that he's available to help mediate, but Modi told him that he has the situation "under control."India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir. India accuses Pakistan of arming insurgents who have been fighting since 1989 for Kashmir's independence from India or its merger with Pakistan. Islamabad denies the charge. About 70,000 people have been killed in the conflict.11:55 a.m.President Donald Trump says there's been no resolution on the fate of scores of Islamic State group fighters in U.S. custody.Trump says he's raising the issue as he meets with leaders attending the Group of Seven summit in France.He commented during a one-on-one meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.The president says it's unfair for the U.S. to pay to keep these fighters. He says many of them came from Europe -- including Germany -- and he wants Europe to take them back.Merkel says her country has already taken in many immigrant families but says the European Union is committed to solving the issue.Trump also says he hopes not to have to impose tariffs on imports of European autos and auto parts as he has threatened.11:45 a.m.President Donald Trump says his private golf resort near Miami is the likely venue for next year's Group of Seven summit. He says no decision has been made, but claims no other venue under consideration matches what his resort -- Trump National Doral -- can offer.This year's G-7 summit is ending Monday in France and the U.S. is hosting the 2020 gathering of the seven nations.Trump says the property, which is just minutes from the Miami airport, has a lot of acreage and properties that would allow delegations from each G-7 country to have its own building.9:45 a.m.President Donald Trump says he wasn't surprised when French President Emmanuel Macron invited Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif to Biarritz in a bid to open talks meant on lowering tensions.Trump says he did not want to get into when Macron talked to him about Zarif. He says: "He asked me. I don't consider that disrespectful at all, especially when he asked me for approval."For several months, Macron has assumed a lead role in trying to save the 2015 nuclear accord, which has been unraveling since Trump pulled the U.S. out of the agreement.Trump had curtly told reporters he had "no comment" on Zarif's presence. Officials said the White House was not aware in advance of the invitation to Zarif.Trump's comments come Monday as he meets with world leaders at the Group of Seven summit in France.9:30 a.m.President Donald Trump says serious negotiations with China will begin after the U.S. received two "very good calls" from Beijing.Trump says "we are going to start talking very seriously." He says the Chinese want to make a deal and he thinks one will finally be reached.Trump says he'll say more about China later Monday.The president commented as he met on the sidelines of the Group of Seven world leader summit taking place in Biarritz, France.Trump last week hiked tariffs on China after China taxed some U.S. imports in retaliation for a previous round of imports levied by Trump.He says the Chinese now "mean business."Trump declined to say whether he has been speaking directly with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Political Chronology

Introduction

Tuvalu's primary concerns since independence have been economic. The country has very limited natural resources, and both colonialism and World War II served to diminish its limited resource base even further. Tuvalu expects to lose a major source of employment income in the near future, since many Tuvaluans work at the phosphate mines in neighboring Nauru, projected to reach final depletion around the turn of the 21st century.

Tuvalu has made compensation claims against the United Kingdom in regard to its dilapidated infrastructure and in particular for damage caused by the construction of Allied air bases during World War II. Indeed, in 1991, the government of Tuvalu announced that it was drafting a compensation claim regarding the terrible state of the country's finances at the time of independence.

Recently, Tuvalu and neighboring islands have begun discussing the possibility of uniting to address their economic, infrastructural and environmental concerns.

In 1996, the government decentralized, placing various departments on other islands, and delegating government responsibilities to island-based councils. Despite the country's ongoing dispute with the United Kingdom, Tuvaluans have consistently voted against motions to establish a republic, though reconstitution of Tuvalu's government along republican lines remains a possibility.

Political Developments from the 1990s to 2009

Tuvalu has seen repeated changes of government as a result of non-confidence motions in parliament. In 1995, Prime Minister Kamuta Latasi -- who was elected to head the government by parliament after indecisive general elections -- attempted to remove Tuvalu from the British Commonwealth and take steps toward initiating a republican system. In response, a coalition member named Puapua withdrew support, as did the deputy prime minister. Ultimately, Latasi lost a vote of confidence in parliament, and Paeniu succeeded him as prime minister in late 1996.

In general elections held in March 1998, Paeniu won enough support to remain prime minister. The new government initiated economic development plans and a constitutional reform plan to be implemented after dialogue with the general population. However, in a sequence of events reminiscent of what occurred a couple of years before, Paeniu's proposals provoked another vote of no confidence, putting him out of office in April 1999. The seven members of parliament who formed the majority toppling Paeniu ascribed their disapproval both to his slow progress in implementing government reforms and to concerns regarding Paeniu's alleged personal misconduct.

Parliament elected Ionatana Ionatana to replace Paeniu as prime minister. His plans include the development of the private sector, infrastructural improvements, and fulfillment of various programs launched by the previous government, notably the establishment of a national trust fund. 

Tuvalu suffered the worst disaster in its post-independence history in March 2000, a fire at a girls' dormitory that killed 18 young women. The dormitory had recently been constructed with assistance funds provided by the government of Japan.

In May 2000, Tuvalu officials finalized a contract with a United States-based Internet company set to pay US$4 million annually for 13 years. The contract confers use of Tuvalu's national domain name-the suffix ".tv" business interests forging the deal expect commercial attractiveness of the suffix to accelerate as interactive video applications become more widespread. The revenues derived from the usage of the suffix has been used to construct schools and to pave roads, which have customarily been made of crushed coral.

In December 2000, Prime Minister Ionatana Ionatana died of a heart attack, while reviewing a public function in the capital Funafuti. Ionatana had been prime minister for just under two years but had won international recognition for his deep concerns over climate change and the impact it is having on low-lying atoll nations such as Tuvalu. He had also won praise for developing Tuvalu's self-sufficiency through a project in which Tuvalu is gaining millions of dollars selling its dot.tv Internet suffix.. Ionatana, a former policeman and top civil servant, also spoke strongly in support of the rights of indigenous Fijians in Fiji following the May 19 coup by indigenous Fijian gunmen led by George Speight. Ionatana's deputy, Lagitupu Tuilimu, the deputy prime minister in Ionatana government, took charge as the acting prime minister upon Ionatana's death. Subsequent prime ministers included Koloa Talake in 2001 and Saufatu Sopoanga in 2002.

Ionatana was buried with full state honors at a funeral attended by several leaders of the region, who praised the departed leader for his contribution in building Tuvalu and also the role that he played in bringing to international attention issues like global warming and the threat posed to the island nations in the Pacific.

In January 2001, Tuvalu received a grant of US$8.6 million from Japan for the construction of an inter-island vessel. An embassy statement said the new passenger and cargo ship will supplement the existing services provided by the Tuvalu government's Nivaga II. The new ship will be assigned to providing regular services from Funafuti to Tuvalu's outer islands while the Nivaga II will be used primarily for services between Tuvalu and Fiji.

In 2002, then-Prime Minister Koloa Telake started legal action against the United Kingdom on the basis of an allegedly unfair division of assets between Tuvalu and Kiribati when the two were divided at the time of independence.

Also in 2002, elections were held in Tuvalu. In the parliamentary elections to the Fale I Fono or House of Assembly held on July 25, 2002, various independents won the 15 available seats. On August 2, 2002, an election was held within the parliament for the position of prime minister. In the election, Saufatu Sopoanga was elected prime minister with 8 votes in favor of his leadership, to Amasone Kilei's 7 votes.

In May 2003, by-elections were held and Prime Minister Sopoanga lost a one seat majority. Members of the opposition asked that the parliament be recalled so that a non-confidence vote could be heard. Several months later, however, the issue was unresolved. As such, opposition members were asking to see the Governor General in regard to the matter.

Throughout 2002 and well into 2003, Tuvalu, along with many other small Pacific island nation states, was faced with the disturbing environmental consequences of climate change. In recent academic studies, attention has been focused on the threat to island coastal areas as temperatures increase, polar ice caps melt and sea level rises as a result. The impact upon small island nations around the world is potentially dangerous. Until recently, less attention has been given to the more immediate effect, which is the matter of freshwater quality and availability.

At present, between 50 and 70 percent of the residents of Samoa have access to safe and drinkable water; in Kiribati and Tuvalu, the number drops to less than 45 percent. Other island nations, such as the Marshall Islands and Micronesia have had to deal with droughts and as rainwater or groundwater are their only freshwater resources, the effects on the population in the region is potentially dangerous. With global warming, droughts are predicted to increase along with the possibility of water shortages; the loss of freshwater resources could cause island nations such as Kiribati and Tuvalu to be uninhabitable.

Islands such as Tuvalu are under threat of being washed away if increases in sea level continue, as a consequence of global warming. Some studies suggest that these islands could cease to exist in 50 years as a result of climate change. The pollution caused by developed countries has become a major bone of contention in the view of small Pacific island states.  (Indeed, as recently as early 2004, locals noticed sea water bubbling up from the soil on the main atoll of Tuvalu in places normally used for flooding.)

In this regard, Tuvalu's former Prime Minister Koloa Talake, along with the leaders of Kiribati and Maldives, intended to launch a lawsuit and other legal measures against polluting countries. His successor, Saufatu Sopoanga, is expected to follow suit. Because of its close proximity, Australia is one of the first countries targeted for legal action, which will be decided in the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Because Australia accepts ICJ jurisdiction, it is considered to be a prime target in such lawsuits.

Meanwhile, New Zealand's government offered assistance in resettling islanders who were being affected by the dangerous rise in sea levels. As well, Australia's overseas aid program established a "land and sea-level" monitoring station in Tuvalu. 

The need for transnational policy on the matter is urgent, however, the countries of this region have very little leverage in the international sphere, especially since the United States and Australia have refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. Environmental issues of this sort are becoming the primary concern of the people and policy-makers in Pacific countries in 2003 and beyond.

Moving to the local political agenda, in August 2004, the country's prime minister, Safatu Sopoanga, suffered a huge setback when a parliament ousted his government in a no-confidence vote. 

With the country's Governor General Faimalaga Luka set to reconvene a swearing-in ceremony for the opposition's new government, several members of the outgoing government did not present themselves at the state house.  Instead,  Safatu Sopoanga announced his resignation from his position as prime minister, effectively forcing a by-election. 

The move was presumably intended to give Sopoanga's cadre more time to consolidate their base of political power base so they could retain leadership in the government.  To this end, they hoped to bring back to their side a member of parliament who had earlier crossed the floor. 

Meanwhile, as these events unfolded, Matia Toafa was made caretaker prime minister until the matter could be resolved. As head of government, Prime Minister Toafa led a review of the Constitution and promised to convene a referendum on whether the British monarch should be replaced as the Head of State -- in effect, moving the country toward the status of a republic.

But in 2006, attention turned to fresh elections, which went off in a free and fair manner on Aug. 3, 2006.  Final results showed that most incumbents had been defeated -- including the vast majority of the cabinet members.  Indeed, the prime minister was an exception, although he would not continue on in his capacity as head of government, as noted below.

The new parliament held its first session on Aug. 14, 2006.  Apisai Ielemia  was chosen to be head of government and Prime Minister. In his inaugural speech,  Prime Minister  Ielemia  made it clear that his policy agenda would include increased media freedom, good governance, transparency and accountability.

In 2007, Tuvalu's envoy to the United Nations, Afelee Pita,  addressed a special session of the United Nations Security Council dealing with the issue of global warming, climate change and the concomitant effect of the rise in sea level in small island nations.  

Two years later, in 2009,  the main issue facing Tuvalu -- as with many small island nations in the South Pacific --  continued to be the matter of geographic survival and its vulnerability to climate change. 

Climate change resulting in the rise in sea level, augmented by high tides, has resulted in beach erosion, soil poisoning,an inability to grow crops, street flooding including main thoroughfares being completely submerged, as well as threats to homes and livelihoods.  Of particular concern is the fact  that a rise in the  saltwater table could destroy deep rooted food crops such as coconut and taro.
Tuvalu is not much higher than sea level.  In 1978, a tide gauge was installed in Tuvalu by the University of Hawaii to measure the rise of sea level.  It measured a rise of 1.2 millimeters per year over 23 years.  This finding coincided with the research from the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC), which showed a  global mean estimated increase  of 1 to 2 millimeters per year over the 20th century.  The IPCC has said that there could be a 40 centimeter increase in sea level by the close of the 21st century -- a level that could have catastrophic effects for a country such as Tuvalu. 

Because Tuvalu is composed of  coral islands, land reclamation is a far more difficult endeavor than in other parts of the world.  Thus, the issue of global climate change has a particularly marked effect in Tuvalu and dominates this country's interests, agenda and policy initiatives.

This issue had other geopolitical implications when, in 2009, Taiwan extended an offer  of assistance to Tuvalu as regards the effects of climate change and the rise in sea level.  Tuvalu has been one of few countries to officially recognize Taiwan as a sovereign nation -- quite separate from Beijing rule. 

Also in  2009, Tuvalu made the decision to apply for membership in the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Special Report on United Nations Climate Change Summit in Copenhagen 

In December 2009, the United Nations Climate Change Summit opened  in the Danish capital of Copenhagen. The summit was scheduled to last from Dec. 7-18, 2009. Delegates from more than 190 countries were in attendance, and approximately 100 world leaders, including British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and United States President Barack Obama, were expected to participate. At issue was the matter of new reductions targets on greenhouse gas emissions by 2020.

On Dec. 9, 2009, four countries -- the United Kingdom, Australia, Mexico and Norway -- presented a document outlining ideas for raising and managing billions of dollars, which would be intended to help vulnerable countries dealing with the perils of climate change.  Described as a "green fund," the concept could potentially help small island states at risk because of the rise in sea level.  The "green fund" would fall under the rubric of  the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, for which developed countries have been committed to quantifying their emission reduction targets, and also to  providing financial and technical support to developing countries.

On Dec. 11, 2009, China demanded that developed and wealthy countries in Copenhagen should help deliver a real agreement on climate change by delivering on their promises to reduce carbon emissions and provide financial support for developing countries to adapt to global warming.  China's Vice Foreign Minister  also emphasized the fact that climate change was "a matter of survival" for developing countries, and accordingly, such countries need wealthier and more developed countries to accentuate not only their pledges of emissions reduction targets, but also their financial commitments under the aforementioned  United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  To that end, scientists and leaders of small island states in the Indian Ocean, the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, have highlighted  the existential threat posed by global warming and the concomitant rise in sea level.
China and India were joined by Brazil and South Africa in the crafting of a draft document calling for a new global climate treaty to be completed  by June 2010. Of concern has been the realization that there was insufficient time to find concurrence on a full legal treaty, which would leave countries only with a politically-binding text by the time the summit at Copenhagen closed. But Guyana's leader, President Bharrat Jagdeo, warned that the summit in Denmark would  be classified as a failure unless a binding document was agreed upon instead of just political consensus. He urged his cohorts to act with purpose saying, "Never before have science, economics, geo-strategic self-interest and politics intersected in such a way on an issue that impacts everyone on the planet."
Likewise, Tuvalu demanded that  legally binding agreements emerge from Copenhagen.  Its proposal was supported by many of the vulnerable countries, from small island states and sub-Saharan Africa, all of whom warned of  the catastrophic impact of climate change on their citizens.  Tuvalu also called for more aggressive action, such as  an amendment to the 1992 agreement, which would focus on sharp greenhouse gas emissions and the accepted rise in temperatures, due to the impact the rise in seas. The delegation from Kiribati joined the call by drawing attention to the fact that one village had to be abandoned due to waist-high water, and  more such effects were likely to follow.  Kiribati's Foreign Secretary, Tessie Lambourne, warned  that the people of Kiribati could well be faced with no homeland in the future  saying, "Nobody in this room would want to leave their homeland." But despite such impassioned pleas and irrespective of warnings from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  that the rise in sea level from melting polar ice caps would deleteriously affect low-lying atolls such as such as Tuvalu and Kiribati in the Pacific, and the Maldives in the Indian Ocean, the oil-giant Saudi Arabia was able to block this move.

By Dec. 12, 2009, details related to a draft document prepared by Michael Zammit Cutajar, the head of the Ad-hoc Working Group on Long-Term Cooperative Action, were released at the  Copenhagen climate conference.  Included in the document were calls for  countries to make major reductions in carbon emissions over the course of the next decade.  According to the Washington Post, industrialized countries were called on to make cuts of between 25 percent and 40 percent below 1990 levels -- reductions that were far more draconian than the United States was likely to accept.  As discussed above, President Obama had offered a provisional reduction target of 17 percent.  The wide gap between the released draft and the United States' actual stated position suggested there was much more negotiating in the offing if a binding agreement could be forged, despite the Obama administration's claims that it was seeking greater engagement on this issue.

The division between developed and developing countries in Copenhagen reached new heights on Dec. 14, 2009, when some of the poor and less developed countries launched a boycott at the summit. The move, which was spurred by African countries but backed by China and India,  appeared to be geared toward redirecting attention and primary responsibility to the wealthier and more industrialized countries.  The impasse was resolved after the  wealthier and more industrialized countries offered assurances that they did not intend on shirking from their commitments to reducing greenhouse gases.  As a result, the participating countries ceased the boycott.

Primer on parliamentary elections of 2010 in Tuvalu
A parliamentary election was scheduled to be held in Tuvalu on September 16, 2010. At stake were the 15 seats in the "Fale I Fono" or unicameral parliament, also called  the House of Assembly.  Typically, members of parliament are elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms, with all seats in the past held by independents.
Parliament was dissolved on August 13, 2010, ahead of the scheduled election date, and in preparation for the national elections.  Ahead of voting day, Prime Minister Apisai Ielemia led a caretaker government for one month.  Prime Minister Ielemia, who completed his first term in office, was hoping to stay on at the helm of government.
The outgoing Tuvalu government said that its priority for the future would be on the development of outer islands. Home Affairs Minister Willie Telavi noted that outer island development had been neglected in the past. Indeed, Tuvalu has been faced with significant geographical and financial challenges in delivering services to the eight atolls of Tuvalu.

Early election results indicated that  Prime Minister Apisai Ielemia was among ten sitting members of parliament re-elected to power.  Also re-elected to power were the incumbent ministers of finance, health and foreign affairs.

The prime minister would therefore seek to form a new coalition government before the end of the month.
But on September 22, 2010, five new members of parliament, who make up a full third of the legislative body, warned that the new government would not be reconstituted at the helm of the country. One such  member of parliament, Enele Sopoanga said, "There's no way that the former government will come back."  In an interview with PacNews, he continued, "There is going to be a change of government early next week and the horse trading for numbers have begun."  Whether or not the new government would include  Prime Minister Apisai Ielemia was yet to be determined.  Indeed, any new government would require the support of eight members of parliament.

Tuvalu Prime Minister Apisai Ielemia gained international cachet in 2009 when, in Copenhagen,  he lobbied for global action against the perils of climate change and the effects of the concomitant rise of sea levels on the lives of people living in small island nations.

On September 29, 2010, in the aftermath of the aforementioned elections and in an internal vote in parliament, it was former Prime Minister Matia Toafa and not Aposai Ielemia who was elected as the new head of government.  It was a reversal of fortune of sorts for the two politicians since Toafa had once lost his seat to Ielemia.  Toafa garnered nine votes in his favor, including five votes from the newly-elected members of parliament, who had signaled that they were in favor of a change in government.

Toafa was inaugurated into office right after the internal parliamentary vote by Governor General Iakopa Italeli Taeia.

In his first public interview with Radio Tuvalu, the new prime minister called on his cabinet to work on behalf of the people of Tuvalu. 

Meanwhile, all five of the new members of parliament were accorded key cabinet positions, including the portfolios for finance, which went to newcomer, Monise Laafai,  and health, which went to journalist, Sauoa Maani.  As well, former diplomat and climate change negotiator, Enele Sopoanga, was given the portfolio for foreign affairs, environment and labor.  All eight cabinet ministers were sworn into office following Prime Minister Toafa's inauguration.

Recent Developments

On Dec. 22, 2010, Tuvalu's parliament was dissolved following a no-confidence vote against Prime Minister Maatia Toafa.  The confidence motion passed successfully when one cabinet minister -- Willy Telavi -- crossed the floor to vote in favor of the motion.  There appeared to be a financial motivation for the vote with members of parliament concerned about the forthcoming budget and allocations for island development, medical treatment costs, and salaries of state workers.  Soon thereafter, nominations were taking place for possible successors to Toafa for the job of head of government.  To that end, the cross-over voter, Willy Telavi, was ultimately elected to take on the role of head of government.  Telavi,  a former police commissioner who held the post of Minister of Home Affairs in the cabinet of Prime Minister Toafa,  was elected on Dec. 24, 2010, defeating Foreign Affairs and Environment Minister Eneke Sopoaga  by a razor thin 8-7 vote.
Telavi's government was at risk more than two years later when at the start of July 2013, Tuvalu's opposition requested that the country's governor general use his special powers to reconvene parliament.  At issue was the result of a by-election that resulted in victory for an opposition candidate for a vacant seat in parliament.  That outcome essentially meant that the government lost its narrow parliamentary majority.  As such, the opposition wanted to have the parliamentary distribution of seats to be confirmed, potentially setting the scene for a no-confidence vote, which could oust the sitting government from power.  For his part, Tuvalu Prime Minister Willy Tevali has not been in a hurry to reconvene parliament given the fact that the government no longer commanded a parliamentary majority.  See below for details.

Parliamentary session in Tuvalu results in ousting of government and election of new PM

An important parliamentary session loomed ahead in Tuvalu, which was expected to decide the fate of the government of Prime Minister Willy Telavi.

At issue was a victory for the opposition in a by-election for a seat on Nukufetau Island  held in mid-June 2013, which offered the opposition the position to command a parliamentary majority.  Now the composition in parliament gave the government seven seats and the opposition eight seats.  Assuming the members of the parliament voted in lockstep with their blocs, such a distribution of parliamentary seats would set the path in motion to bring down the government of Prime Minister Willy Tevali. Anxious to test the possibility that it could form a new government, the opposition has been angling for a new parliamentary session in which it could bring forth a confidence vote.

At the start of July 2013, Tuvalu's governor general, Sir Lakoba Italeli, acquiesced to the calls from the opposition and ordered parliament to sit in session on July 30, 2013. It would be the first sitting of parliament since late December 2012 when the member of parliament passed a budget.  This session at the end of July 2013 would predictably include the introduction of a no-confidence motion by the opposition against the Tevali government.

It should be noted that Tuvalu's political scene has been marked by stalemate since late 2012 with the only productive bit of business done at the time was the passage of the budget, as noted above. Now, according to Opposition Spokesperson Taukalina Finikaso, it was way past time to shift the dynamics. As noted by Finikaso, "We have been in this uncertainty for quite a long period. It is seven months now and we cannot continue on like this without parliament meeting and without the nation knowing what is happening. So we think it is a very good decision by the governor general and I think he has done it in the spirit of the constitution and also the democratic nation of Tuvalu."

Now, with the parliamentary session looming ahead and a no-confidence vote in the offing, the opposition was expressing confidence that it was united and had the seats to command a majority.  Accordingly, Opposition Spokesperson  Finikaso believed that voting on the confidence measure would, therefore,  go its way.  Indeed, among the opposition ranks, there were high hopes that the vote would result in the toppling of the government and the formation of a new government. But the prime minister was equally confident that he had the support to defeat the no confidence motion, thanks to the support of a couple of cross-over votes,  and he would ultimately hold sway in command of the government.  Indeed, Prime Minister  Willy Telavi's stance appeared to be that of a man spoiling for a fight he was sure to win.  It was to be seen which side would prove to be correct.

Politically, the advantage seemed to be with the opposition at the start of August 2013. First, the government's faction in parliament was short at least one vote due to the death of Finance Minister Lotoala Metia in December 2012. Second, ill health of Education Minister Falesa Pitoi meant that the government would be short an additional member.  Third, the  pro-government faction in parliament was further diminished when Health Minister Taom Tanukale resigned from parliament.  But things moved in a decidedly dismal direction for those in power when Prime MInister Telavi's government lost a motion to dissolve parliament before the anticipated  vote of no confidence could be taken against them.

The scene in parliament turned dramatic when the opposition advanced its no-confidence vote in the Telavi government only to have Tuvalu's Speaker of Parliament refuse the motion and announced an adjournment.  Governor General Iakopa Italeli Taeia entered the fray and called for the parliament to meet and resume activity. This move sparked a  battle of wills between the prime minister and the governor general when Telavi said that he was removing Governor General Iakopa Italeli Taeia from his post as the head of state. Hours later,  however, Italeli said he was removing Prime Minister Telavi and his cabinet from office and appointing the opposition leader, Enele Sopoanga, as a caretaker prime minister. The scenario  had all the makings of a constitutional crisis.  But regardless of Telavi's claim on legitimacy, the fact of the matter was that the numbers in parliament favored the parliament.

Ultimately on Aug. 2, 2013, a majority of members of parliament supported the no-confidence motion and officially brought down Telavi's government.  Later in the parliamentary session,  Enele Sopoaga --  the opposition leader -- was elected to serve as the new prime minister.

Prime Minister Sopoanga soon unveiled his cabinet and the new government was sworn into power by the governor general, Sir Iakoba Italeli in Funafuti.  Included in the government was the deputy premier, Vete Sakaio, who would also be responsible for public utilities.  Former diplomat, Finikaso Taukelina, a former diplomat,  who would become the new minister for foreign affairs. Home Affairs, which was normally part of the prime minister's portfolio, would become a separate government ministry with Namoliku Sualiki at the helm. The health portfolio and the education portfolio were merged under one ministry to be headed by Fauoa Maani. The portfolio for finance and economic development would be held by Maatia Toafa, a former prime minister.  Meanwhile,  the portfolio for communication and transport, as well as the portfolio for natural resources, would be held by  Monisa Laafai and Elisala Pita respectively.

Note: It should be noted that irrespective of the inauguration of the new Tuvalu government, its legitimacy remained a matter of debate.  There was a court decision pending over the actions taken by both the governor general and the former prime minister, leading up to the installation of the new government.
Elections Note:

Parliamentary elections were set to be held on March 19, 2015, in Tuvalu; they were delayed (as discussed below) due to Cyclone Pam and ultimately held on March 31, 2015.  At stake was the composition of the unicameral parliament, also called the House of Assembly or "Fale I Fono."  In this body, the seats are occupied by members who are elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms.  There are no functional parties vying for control of the legislative chamber; instead, all members of parliament are political independents.

From 2010 to 2015, Tuvalu has seen a parade of prime ministers as rivalries, confidence motions, and political machinations have brought down one government after the other.  Since 2013, Enele Sopoaga has  served as the caretaker prime minister.  The Sopoaga government increased its majority in parliament over the course of 2014 as a result of two by-elections.  It was to be seen if the Sopoaga government  would win a mandate in the 2015 parliamentary contest.

But the answer to the question of who would lead the new Tuvalu government was left unanswered due to a weather crisis.  Cyclone Pam hit the islands of the south Pacific hard, with Tuvalu being among those particularly hard-hit. Indeed, Tuvalu's election was postponed due to the damage wrought by Cyclone Pam, which left the country in dire need of fresh water supplies and other forms of emergency assistance.

Voters finally went to the polls on March 31, 2015, and ultimately, most of the members of parliament were returned to power.  This result set the stage for  the government of Enele Sopoaga to return to power.  To that end, on April 10, 2015, it was announced officially that  Sopoaga was returned to power as Tuvalu's prime minister. In parliament he had a clear majority, given the support of 11 out of the 15 allied elected members of parliament.

Editor's Update:

Note that Tuvalu's election, scheduled to be held on March 19, 2015 as noted above,  was postponed due to the damage wrought by Cyclone Pam.  That cyclone hit the islands of the Pacific hard and  left Tuvalu in dire need of fresh water supplies and other forms of emergency assistance. 

Election of 2019:
Parliamentary elections were set to be held on Sept. 9, 2019 in Tuvalu.  At stake was the composition of the unicameral parliament, also called the House of Assembly or "Fale I Fono."  In this body, there are 16 seats occupied by members who are elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms.  There are no functional parties vying for control of the legislative chamber; instead, all members of parliament are political independents. 

Following these elections, once the composition of the House of Assembly was decided, an internal vote within the legislative chamber was carried out to determine the new head of government.  Kausea Natano won 10 of the 16 votes at stake and was inaugurated as the new prime minister on Sept. 19, 2019.

Environmental Note:

Small island countries announce plan to sue multinational fossil fuel corporations for their role in climate change --

In mid-2015, six small island nation states -- Vanuatu, Kiribati, Tuvalu, Fiji, Solomon Islands and  Philippines -- released a manifesto on climate change.  Dubbed the  "People's Declaration for Climate Justice,"  the declaration announced a plan to sue large multinational fossil fuel corporations, which they blamed for  carbon pollution,  the degradation to their ecosystems, and the other deleterious effects of climate change.

The highlights of the manifesto read as follows:  "We, the people of Vanuatu, Kiribati, Tuvalu, Fiji, Solomon Islands and the Philippines continue to experience the impacts of climate change - the single biggest human rights, environmental and humanitarian crisis of our time As the people most acutely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, we will not let the big polluters decide and assign our fate We commit to holding those most responsible for climate change accountable. By doing so, we send a message of hope that the people and not the polluters are in charge of humanity's destiny. "  In truth, the effort to sue the world's largest fossil fuel corporations would not be a simple endeavor and  the plaintiff nation states might not even see their day in court; however, small island countries were not willing to silently accept the pressing environmental threat to their existence without seeking accountability.

Editor's Entry on Environmental Policy:

Small island nations across the world are  vulnerable to the threats posed by global warming and cimate change, derived from carbon emissions, and resulting in the rise in sea level.  Political policy in the country is often connected to ecological issues, which have over time morphed into an existential crisis of sorts.

December 2012 saw climate talks in the Qatari city of Doha.  There, representatives from countries across the world gathered to discuss the fate of the Kyoto Protocol, which seeks to minimize greenhouse gas emissions.  The summit yielded results with  decisions made (1) to extend the Kyoto Protocol until 2020, and (2) for wealthier countries to compensate poorer countries for the losses and damage incurred as a result of climate change.

There was, in fact, little progress made on the central issue of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  Had those emissions been reduced, there would have been less of a need to financially deal with the devastation caused by climate change.  One interpretation was that the global community was accepting the fact that industrialization was contributing to global warming, which had deleterious effects on the polar ice caps  and concomitantly on the rise of sea level, with devastating effects for small island nations. Thus, wealthier countries were willing to pay around $10 billion a year through 2020, effectively in "damages," to the poor countries that could be viewed as the "collateral damage" of industrial progress.  But damages today could potentially be destruction tomorrow, leaving in place the existential challenges and burdens to be born by some of the world's smallest and least wealthy island countries.

Perhaps not surprisingly, the  representative for the small island nation states at the Doha summit responded with ire, characterizing the lack of progress on reducing emissions as follows: "We see the package before us as deeply deficient in mitigation (carbon cuts) and finance. It's likely to lock us on the trajectory to a 3,4,5C rise in global temperatures, even though we agreed to keep the global average temperature rise of 1.5C to ensure survival of all islands. There is no new finance (for adapting to climate change and getting clean energy) -- only promises that something might materialize in the future. Those who are obstructive need to talk not about how their people will live, but whether our people will live."

Indeed, in most small island countries not just in the Pacific, but also the Caribbean and Indian Ocean, ecological concerns and the climate crisis have been dominant themes with dire life and death consequences looming in the background for their people.  Small island nations in these region  are already at risk from the rise of sea-level, tropical cyclones, floods.  But  their very livelihoods of fishing and subsistence farming are also at risk as a result of ecological and environmental changes.  Of particular concern is the matter of  ocean acidification, which destroys  reefs and decimates fish and shellfish populations that provide protein for inhabitants.  At the same time, increasingly high storm surges can wipe out  coastlines, and even  entire villages, while

contaminating water supplies.  Accordingly, the very existence of islands are at severe risk of being obliterated from the map.  Yet even with the existential threat of being wiped off the map in the offing, the international community has been either slow or restrictive in its efforts to deal with global warming, climate change, economic and ecological damage, as well as the emerging global challenge of environmental refugees.

A 2012  report from the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the Pacific Regional Environment Program underlined the concerns of small island nations and their people as it concluded that the livelihoods of approximately 10 million people in Pacific island communities were increasingly vulnerable to climate change. In fact, low-lying islands in that region  would likely confront  losses of up to 18 percent of gross domestic product due to climate change, according to the report. The report covers 21 countries and territories, including Fiji, Kiribati,  Samoa and Tonga, and recommended  environmental legislation intended to deal with the climate crisis facing the small island countries particularly. As noted by David Sheppard, the director general of the Pacific Regional Environment Program that co-sponsored this study: "The findings... emphasize the need more than ever to raise the bar through collective actions that address the region's environmental needs at all levels."

Special Report

COP 21 summit in Paris ends with historic agreement to tackle climate change; rare international consensus formed on environmental crisis facing the planet --

In mid-December 2015, the highly-anticipated United Nations climate conference of parties (COP) in Paris, France, ended with a historic agreement.  In fact, it would very likely be understood as the most significant international agreement signed by all the recognized countries of the world since the Cold War.  Accordingly, the Paris Agreement was being distinguished as the first multilateral pact that would compel all countries across the world to cut its carbon emissions -- one of the major causes of increasing greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to global warming, and its deleterious effects ranging from the dangerous rise in sea level to catastrophic climate change.

The accord, which was dubbed to be the "Paris Agreement," was the work of rigorous diplomacy and fervent environmental advocacy, and it aimed to address the climate change crisis facing the planet.  As many as 195  countries were represented in the negotiations that led to the landmark climate deal.  Indeed, it was only after  weeks of passionate debate that  international concurrence was reached in addressing the environmental challenges confronting the world, with particular attention to moving beyond fossil fuels and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The success of the COP 21 summit in Paris and the emergence of the landmark Paris Agreement was, to some extent, attributed to the efforts of France's  Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius who presided over the negotiations.  The French foreign minister's experience and credentials as a seasoned diplomat and respected statesman paid dividends.  He skillfully guided the delegates from almost 200 countries and interest groups along the negotiations process, with ostensibly productive results and a reasonably robust deal to show for it.

On Dec. 12, 2015, French Foreign Minister Fabius officially adopted the agreement, declaring: "I now invite the COP to adopt the decision entitled Paris Agreement outlined in the document.  Looking out to the room I see that the reaction is positive, I see no objections. The Paris agreement is adopted."  Once Foreign Minister Fabius' gavel was struck, symbolically inaugurating the Paris Agreement into force, the COP delegate rushed to their feet with loud and bouyant cheers as well as thunderous applause.

In general, the Paris Agreement was being hailed as a victory for enviromental activists and a triumph for international diplomats, while at the same time being understood as simply an initial -- and imperfect -- move in the direction of a sustainable future.

China's chief negotiator, Xie Zhenhua, issued this  message, saying that while the accord was not ideal,  it should "not prevent us from marching historical steps forward."

United States President  Barack Obama lauded the deal as both "ambitious" and "historic,"  and the work of strenuous multilateral negotiations as he declared, "Together, we've shown what's possible when the world stands as one."  The United States leader acknowledged that the accord  was not "perfect," but he reminded the critics that it was "the best chance to save the one planet we have. "

Former United States Vice President Al Gore, one of the world's most well known environmental advocates, issued a lengthy statement on the accompishments ensconced in the Paris Agreement.  He highlighted the fact that the Paris Agreement was a first step towards a future with a reduced carbon footprint on Planet Earth as he said,  "The components of this agreement -- including a strong review mechanism to enhance existing commitments and a long-term goal to eliminate global-warming pollution this century -- are essential to unlocking the necessary investments in our future. No agreement is perfect, and this one must be strengthened over time, but groups across every sector of society will now begin to reduce dangerous carbon pollution through the framework of this agreement."

The central provisions of the Paris Agreement included the following items:

- Greenhouse gas emissions should peak as quickly as possible, with a move towards balancing energy sources, and ultimately the decrease of  greenhouse gases in the second half of this century
- Global temperature increase would be limited to 1.5 degrees Centigrade  above pre-industrial levels and would be held "well below" the  two degrees Centigrade threshold
-  Progress on these goals would be reviewed  every five years beginning in 2020 with new  greenhouse gas reduction targets issued every five years
- $100 billion would be expended each year in climate finance for developing countries to move forward with green technologies, with further climate financing to be advanced in the years beyond

It should be noted that there both  legally binding and voluntary elements contained within the Paris Agreement. Specifically, the  submission of an emissions reduction target and the regular review of that goal would be legally mandatory for all countries.  Stated differently, there would be a system in place by which  experts would be able to track the carbon-cutting progress of each country.  At the same time, the specific targets to be set by countries would be determined at the discretion of the countries, and would not be binding.  While there was some criticism over this non-binding element, the fact of the matter was that the imposition of emissions targets was believed to be a major factor in the failure of climate change talks in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 2009. 

In 2015, the talks faced challenges as several countries, such as China and India, objected to conditions that would stymie economic and development. In order to avoid that kind of landmine, a system Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) was developed and formed the basis of the accord. As such, the Paris Agreement would, in fact,  facilitate economic growth and development, as well as technological progress, but with the goal of long-term ecological sustainability based on low carbon  sources.  In fact, the agreement heralded as "the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel era."  As noted by Nick Mabey, the head of the climate diplomacy organization E3G, said, "Paris means governments will go further and faster to tackle climate change than ever before.  The transition to a low carbon economy is now unstoppable, ensuring the end of the fossil fuel age."

A particular sticking point in the agreement was the $100 billion earmarked for  climate financing for developing countries to transition from traditional fossil fuels to green energy technologies and a low carbon future.  In 2014, a report by the  International Energy Agency indicated that the cost of that transition would actually be around $44 trillion by the mid-century -- an amount that would render the $100 billion being promised to be a drop in the proverbial bucket.  However, the general expectation was that the Republican-controlled Senate in the United States, which would have to ratify the deal in that country, was not interested in contributing significant funds for the cause of climate change. 

A key strength of the Paris Agreement was the ubiquitous application of measures to all countries.  Of note was the frequently utilized concept of "flexibility" with regard to the Paris Agreement.  Specifically,  the varying capacities of the various countries in meeting their obligations would be anticipated and accorded flexibility.  This aspect presented something of a departure from the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which drew a sharp distinction between developed and developing countries, and mandated a different set of obligations for those categories of countries.  Thus, under Kyoto, China and India were not held to the same standards as the United States and European countries.

In the Paris Agreement, there would be commitments from all countries across the globe.

Another notable strength of the Paris Agreement was the fact that the countries of the world were finally able to reach consensus on the vital necessity to limit global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Centrigrade.  Ahead of the global consensus on the deal, and as controversy continued to surface over the targeted global temperature limits, the leaders of island countries were sounding the alarm about the melting of the Polar ice caps and the associated rise in seal level.  Prime Minister

Enele Sopoaga of Tuvalu issued this dismal reminder: "Tuvalu's future  is already bleak and any further temperature increase will spell the total demise of Tuvalu. No leader in this room carries such a level of worry and responsibility. Just imagine you are in my shoes, what would you do?"  It was thus something of a victory for environmental advocates that the countries of the world could find cnsensus on the lower number -- 1.5 degrees rather than 2 degrees.

A  significant weak point with regard to the Paris deal was a "loss and damage" provision, which anticipates that even with all the new undertakings intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and move to a low carbon future, there would nonetheless be unavoidable climate change consequences.  Those consequences ranged from the loss of arable land for farmers as well as soil erosion and contamination of potable water by sea water, to the decimation of territory in coastal zones and on small islands, due to the rise in sea level, with entire small island countries being rendered entirely uninhabitable.  The reality was that peoples' homes across the world would be destroyed along with their way of life.

With that latter catastrophic effect being a clear and present danger for small island countries, the  Association of Small Island States (AOSIS) demanded that the developed world acknowledge its responsibility for this irreversible damage..

Despite the fact that greenhouse gas emissions and the ensuing plague of global warming was, indeed, the consequence of development in the West (the United States and Europe) and the large power house countries, such as Russia, China and India,  there was no appetite by those countries to sign on to unlimited liability.  Under the Paris Agreement,  there was a call for  research  on insurance mechanisms that would address loss and damage issues, with recommendations to come in the future.

The call for research was being regarded as an evasion of sorts and constituted the weakest aspect of the Paris Agreement.  Not surprisingly, a coalition of small island nations demanded a "Marshall Plan" for the Pacific.  Borrowing the term "Marshall Plan" from the post-World War II reconstruction effort, the coalition of Pacific island nation, which included Kiribati, Tuvalu, Fiji, and the Marshall Islands, called for an initiative that would include investment in renewable energy and shoreline protection,  cultural preservation, economic assistance for economies in transition, and a plan for migration and resettlement for these countries as they confront the catastrophic effects of the melting of the Polar ice caps and the concomitant rise in sea level.  The precise contours of the initiative remained unknown, unspecified, and a mere exercise in theory at the time of writing.  Yet such an initiative would, at some point, have to be addressed, given the realities of climate change and the slow motion calamity unfolding each day for low-lying island nations across the world.

As noted by Vice President Greg Stone of  Conservation International, who also functions as  an adviser to the government of Kiribati, "Imagine living in a place where you know it's going to go away someday, but you don't know what day that wave's going to come over and wash your home away."  He added, "It's a disaster we know is going to happen."

Meanwhile, the intervening years promised to be filled with hardship for small island nations, such as Kiribati.  Stone explained, "For every inch of sea-level rise, these islands lose 10 feet of their freshwater table to saltwater intrusion," Stone explained. "So it's not just about the day the water finally goes over the island; it's also about the day that there's just not enough water left and everyone has to move off the island."  Presaging the future for island nations that could face submersion, Stone said, "If you look ahead 50 years, a country like Kiribati could become the first aqueous nation. possibility of migration. That is, they own this big patch of ocean, and they administer it from elsewhere."

Foreign Minister Minister Tony Debrum of the Marshall Islands emerged as the champion advocating on behalf of small island nation states and a loose coalition of concerned countries from the Pacific to the Caribbean, but with support from the United States.  He addressed the comprehensive concerns of small island nations regarding the weaknesses of the deal, while simultaneously making clear that the Paris Agreement signified hope for the countries most at risk.  In a formal statement, Debrum declared: "We have made history today. Emissions targets are still way off track, but this agreement has the tools to ramp up ambition, and brings a spirit of hope that we can rise to this challenge. I can go back home to my people and say we now have a pathway to survival."  Debrum highlighted the imperatives of Pacific island nations, saying, "Our High Ambition Coalition was the lightning rod we needed to lift our sights and expectations for a strong agreement here in Paris. We were joined by countries representing more than half the world. We said loud and clear that a bare-bones, minimalist agreement would not fly. We instead demanded an agreement to mark a turning point in history, and the beginning of our journey to the post-carbon era."

Debrum of the Marshall Islands espoused the quintessential synopsis of the accord and its effects for those most likely to be affected by climate change as he noted, "Climate change won't stop overnight, and my country is not out of the firing line just yet, but today we all feel a little safer."
Special Note Affecting Pacific Island Nations:
The impact of climate change as grounds for asylum --

In March 2018, New Zealand became the first country in the world to recognize the deleterious impact of climate change as grounds for asylum.  

Neighboring island nation states in the Pacific Ocean were experiencing the effects of climate change as an existential crisis.  The rise of sea level, the erosion of coastlines, and loss of potable water and soil needed for survival was impacting the viability of Pacific countries such as the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Kiribati, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, Palau, among others.  Some countries were expected to be wiped off the map by the end of the century, generating entire nations of environmental refugees. 

Environmental refugees do not enjoy protections under international law as  the 1951 Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees protects persons fleeing persecution, from war or violence and not environmental crisis.  Moreover, the people of environmentally affected countries often do not want to be classified as refugees anyway. 
Former President Anote Tong of Kiribati has emphasized that the people of his country, quite likely to be rendered geographically homeless within decades, wanted to "migrate with dignity."

Against this backdrop,  New Zealand -- led by its Labour Party government, backed by the Green Party --  became the first country in the world to recognize the deleterious impact of climate change as grounds for asylum.  Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced plans to create a special visa for Pacific Islanders rendered homeless and forced to relocate because of the rise of sea level.  The program would begin in a limited manner - with only 100 visas offered annually.  However, it would serve as a precedent of sorts, setting an example for other countries to follow and also offer assistance. 

As noted by former Prime Minister Helen Clark via Twitter, New Zealand already had in place "significant migrant quotas for citizens of its Pacific neighbours" as part of its good neighbor policy. The new visa program would build upon this foundation. 

At the international level, the move by New Zealand could encourage assistance by other countries irrespective of legal recognition of refugee status by the United nations, Moreover,  it is an extension of the

"Protection Agenda" which 109 countries endorsed in 2015, and which seeks to organize resources to help the people affected by catastrophic effects of climate change. 
Editor's Entry on Environmental Policy: 

The low-lying Pacific island nations of the world, including Kiribati, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, Fiji, among others, are  vulnerable to the threats posed by global warming and cimate change, derived from carbon emissions, and resulting in the rise in sea level.  Other island nations in the Caribbean, as well as poor countries with coastal zones, were also at particular risk of suffering the deleterious effects of climate change.

Political policy in these countries are often connected to ecological issues, which have over time morphed into an existential crisis of sorts.  Indeed,  ecological concerns and the climate crisis have  also been dominant themes with life and death consequences for the people of island nations in the Pacific.  Indeed, the very livelihoods of fishing and subsistence farming remain at risk as a result of ecological and environmental changes.

Yet even so, these countries are threatened by increasingly high storm surges, which could wipe out entire villages and contaminate water supplies.  Moreover, because these are low lying island nations, the sustained rise in sea level can potentially lead to the terrain of these countries being unihabitable at best, and submerged at worst.  Stated in plain terms, these countries are at severe risk of being obliterated from the map and their plight illuminates the emerging global challenge of environmental refugees.  In these manifold senses, climate change is the existential crisis of the contemporary era.

Since the time of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, there have been efforts aimed at extending the life of that agreement, with an eye on minimizing greenhouse gas emissions, and thus minimizing the effects of climate change.  Those endeavors have largely ended in failure, as exemplified by the unsuccessful Copenhagen talks in 2009 and the fruitless Doha talks in 2012 respectively.  The success of the COP 21 talks in France, with the adoption of the landmark Paris Agreement in 2015, was regarded as the first glimmer of hope.  Not only did the Paris Agreement signify the triumph of international diplomacy and global consensus, but it also marked the start of the end of the fossil fuel era, with the path forward toward a low carbon future reliant on greener technologies.  Most crucially, the Paris Agreement stood as the first significant response in recent times to the central challenge of climate change and its quotidian effects on the lives of real human beings across the world.

Introduction

Tuvalu's primary concerns since independence have been economic. The country has very limited natural resources, and both colonialism and World War II served to diminish its limited resource base even further. Tuvalu expects to lose a major source of employment income in the near future, since many Tuvaluans work at the phosphate mines in neighboring Nauru, projected to reach final depletion around the turn of the 21st century.
Tuvalu has made compensation claims against the United Kingdom in regard to its dilapidated infrastructure and in particular for damage caused by the construction of Allied air bases during World War II. Indeed, in 1991, the government of Tuvalu announced that it was drafting a compensation claim regarding the terrible state of the country's finances at the time of independence.
Recently, Tuvalu and neighboring islands have begun discussing the possibility of uniting to address their economic, infrastructural and environmental concerns.
In 1996, the government decentralized, placing various departments on other islands, and delegating government responsibilities to island-based councils. Despite the country's ongoing dispute with the United Kingdom, Tuvaluans have consistently voted against motions to establish a republic, though reconstitution of Tuvalu's government along republican lines remains a possibility.

Political Developments from the 1990s to 2009
Tuvalu has seen repeated changes of government as a result of non-confidence motions in parliament. In 1995, Prime Minister Kamuta Latasi -- who was elected to head the government by parliament after indecisive general elections -- attempted to remove Tuvalu from the British Commonwealth and take steps toward initiating a republican system. In response, a coalition member named Puapua withdrew support, as did the deputy prime minister. Ultimately, Latasi lost a vote of confidence in parliament, and Paeniu succeeded him as prime minister in late 1996.
In general elections held in March 1998, Paeniu won enough support to remain prime minister. The new government initiated economic development plans and a constitutional reform plan to be implemented after dialogue with the general population. However, in a sequence of events reminiscent of what occurred a couple of years before, Paeniu's proposals provoked another vote of no confidence, putting him out of office in April 1999. The seven members of parliament who formed the majority toppling Paeniu ascribed their disapproval both to his slow progress in implementing government reforms and to concerns regarding Paeniu's alleged personal misconduct.
Parliament elected Ionatana Ionatana to replace Paeniu as prime minister. His plans include the development of the private sector, infrastructural improvements, and fulfillment of various programs launched by the previous government, notably the establishment of a national trust fund.
Tuvalu suffered the worst disaster in its post-independence history in March 2000, a fire at a girls' dormitory that killed 18 young women. The dormitory had recently been constructed with assistance funds provided by the government of Japan.
In May 2000, Tuvalu officials finalized a contract with a United States-based Internet company set to pay US$4 million annually for 13 years. The contract confers use of Tuvalu's national domain name-the suffix ".tv" business interests forging the deal expect commercial attractiveness of the suffix to accelerate as interactive video applications become more widespread. The revenues derived from the usage of the suffix has been used to construct schools and to pave roads, which have customarily been made of crushed coral.
In December 2000, Prime Minister Ionatana Ionatana died of a heart attack, while reviewing a public function in the capital Funafuti. Ionatana had been prime minister for just under two years but had won international recognition for his deep concerns over climate change and the impact it is having on low-lying atoll nations such as Tuvalu. He had also won praise for developing Tuvalu's self-sufficiency through a project in which Tuvalu is gaining millions of dollars selling its dot.tv Internet suffix.. Ionatana, a former policeman and top civil servant, also spoke strongly in support of the rights of indigenous Fijians in Fiji following the May 19 coup by indigenous Fijian gunmen led by George Speight. Ionatana's deputy, Lagitupu Tuilimu, the deputy prime minister in Ionatana government, took charge as the acting prime minister upon Ionatana's death. Subsequent prime ministers included Koloa Talake in 2001 and Saufatu Sopoanga in 2002.
Ionatana was buried with full state honors at a funeral attended by several leaders of the region, who praised the departed leader for his contribution in building Tuvalu and also the role that he played in bringing to international attention issues like global warming and the threat posed to the island nations in the Pacific.
In January 2001, Tuvalu received a grant of US$8.6 million from Japan for the construction of an inter-island vessel. An embassy statement said the new passenger and cargo ship will supplement the existing services provided by the Tuvalu government's Nivaga II. The new ship will be assigned to providing regular services from Funafuti to Tuvalu's outer islands while the Nivaga II will be used primarily for services between Tuvalu and Fiji.
In 2002, then-Prime Minister Koloa Telake started legal action against the United Kingdom on the basis of an allegedly unfair division of assets between Tuvalu and Kiribati when the two were divided at the time of independence.
Also in 2002, elections were held in Tuvalu. In the parliamentary elections to the Fale I Fono or House of Assembly held on July 25, 2002, various independents won the 15 available seats. On August 2, 2002, an election was held within the parliament for the position of prime minister. In the election, Saufatu Sopoanga was elected prime minister with 8 votes in favor of his leadership, to Amasone Kilei's 7 votes.
In May 2003, by-elections were held and Prime Minister Sopoanga lost a one seat majority. Members of the opposition asked that the parliament be recalled so that a non-confidence vote could be heard. Several months later, however, the issue was unresolved. As such, opposition members were asking to see the Governor General in regard to the matter.
Throughout 2002 and well into 2003, Tuvalu, along with many other small Pacific island nation states, was faced with the disturbing environmental consequences of climate change. In recent academic studies, attention has been focused on the threat to island coastal areas as temperatures increase, polar ice caps melt and sea level rises as a result. The impact upon small island nations around the world is potentially dangerous. Until recently, less attention has been given to the more immediate effect, which is the matter of freshwater quality and availability.
At present, between 50 and 70 percent of the residents of Samoa have access to safe and drinkable water; in Kiribati and Tuvalu, the number drops to less than 45 percent. Other island nations, such as the Marshall Islands and Micronesia have had to deal with droughts and as rainwater or groundwater are their only freshwater resources, the effects on the population in the region is potentially dangerous. With global warming, droughts are predicted to increase along with the possibility of water shortages; the loss of freshwater resources could cause island nations such as Kiribati and Tuvalu to be uninhabitable.
Islands such as Tuvalu are under threat of being washed away if increases in sea level continue, as a consequence of global warming. Some studies suggest that these islands could cease to exist in 50 years as a result of climate change. The pollution caused by developed countries has become a major bone of contention in the view of small Pacific island states.  (Indeed, as recently as early 2004, locals noticed sea water bubbling up from the soil on the main atoll of Tuvalu in places normally used for flooding.)
In this regard, Tuvalu's former Prime Minister Koloa Talake, along with the leaders of Kiribati and Maldives, intended to launch a lawsuit and other legal measures against polluting countries. His successor, Saufatu Sopoanga, is expected to follow suit. Because of its close proximity, Australia is one of the first countries targeted for legal action, which will be decided in the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Because Australia accepts ICJ jurisdiction, it is considered to be a prime target in such lawsuits.
Meanwhile, New Zealand's government offered assistance in resettling islanders who were being affected by the dangerous rise in sea levels. As well, Australia's overseas aid program established a "land and sea-level" monitoring station in Tuvalu. 

The need for transnational policy on the matter is urgent, however, the countries of this region have very little leverage in the international sphere, especially since the United States and Australia have refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. Environmental issues of this sort are becoming the primary concern of the people and policy-makers in Pacific countries in 2003 and beyond.
Moving to the local political agenda, in August 2004, the country's prime minister, Safatu Sopoanga, suffered a huge setback when a parliament ousted his government in a no-confidence vote.
With the country's Governor General Faimalaga Luka set to reconvene a swearing-in ceremony for the opposition's new government, several members of the outgoing government did not present themselves at the state house.  Instead,  Safatu Sopoanga announced his resignation from his position as prime minister, effectively forcing a by-election.
The move was presumably intended to give Sopoanga's cadre more time to consolidate their base of political power base so they could retain leadership in the government.  To this end, they hoped to bring back to their side a member of parliament who had earlier crossed the floor. 

Meanwhile, as these events unfolded, Matia Toafa was made caretaker prime minister until the matter could be resolved. As head of government, Prime Minister Toafa led a review of the Constitution and promised to convene a referendum on whether the British monarch should be replaced as the Head of State -- in effect, moving the country toward the status of a republic.

But in 2006, attention turned to fresh elections, which went off in a free and fair manner on Aug. 3, 2006.  Final results showed that most incumbents had been defeated -- including the vast majority of the cabinet members.  Indeed, the prime minister was an exception, although he would not continue on in his capacity as head of government, as noted below.

The new parliament held its first session on Aug. 14, 2006.  Apisai Ielemia  was chosen to be head of government and Prime Minister. In his inaugural speech,  Prime Minister  Ielemia  made it clear that his policy agenda would include increased media freedom, good governance, transparency and accountability.

In 2007, Tuvalu's envoy to the United Nations, Afelee Pita,  addressed a special session of the United Nations Security Council dealing with the issue of global warming, climate change and the concomitant effect of the rise in sea level in small island nations.  

Two years later, in 2009,  the main issue facing Tuvalu -- as with many small island nations in the South Pacific --  continued to be the matter of geographic survival and its vulnerability to climate change. 

Climate change resulting in the rise in sea level, augmented by high tides, has resulted in beach erosion, soil poisoning,an inability to grow crops, street flooding including main thoroughfares being completely submerged, as well as threats to homes and livelihoods.  Of particular concern is the fact  that a rise in the  saltwater table could destroy deep rooted food crops such as coconut and taro.
Tuvalu is not much higher than sea level.  In 1978, a tide gauge was installed in Tuvalu by the University of Hawaii to measure the rise of sea level.  It measured a rise of 1.2 millimeters per year over 23 years.  This finding coincided with the research from the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC), which showed a  global mean estimated increase  of 1 to 2 millimeters per year over the 20th century.  The IPCC has said that there could be a 40 centimeter increase in sea level by the close of the 21st century -- a level that could have catastrophic effects for a country such as Tuvalu. 

Because Tuvalu is composed of  coral islands, land reclamation is a far more difficult endeavor than in other parts of the world.  Thus, the issue of global climate change has a particularly marked effect in Tuvalu and dominates this country's interests, agenda and policy initiatives.

This issue had other geopolitical implications when, in 2009, Taiwan extended an offer  of assistance to Tuvalu as regards the effects of climate change and the rise in sea level.  Tuvalu has been one of few countries to officially recognize Taiwan as a sovereign nation -- quite separate from Beijing rule. 

Also in  2009, Tuvalu made the decision to apply for membership in the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Special Report on United Nations Climate Change Summit in Copenhagen 

In December 2009, the United Nations Climate Change Summit opened  in the Danish capital of Copenhagen. The summit was scheduled to last from Dec. 7-18, 2009. Delegates from more than 190 countries were in attendance, and approximately 100 world leaders, including British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and United States President Barack Obama, were expected to participate. At issue was the matter of new reductions targets on greenhouse gas emissions by 2020.

On Dec. 9, 2009, four countries -- the United Kingdom, Australia, Mexico and Norway -- presented a document outlining ideas for raising and managing billions of dollars, which would be intended to help vulnerable countries dealing with the perils of climate change.  Described as a "green fund," the concept could potentially help small island states at risk because of the rise in sea level.  The "green fund" would fall under the rubric of  the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, for which developed countries have been committed to quantifying their emission reduction targets, and also to  providing financial and technical support to developing countries.

On Dec. 11, 2009, China demanded that developed and wealthy countries in Copenhagen should help deliver a real agreement on climate change by delivering on their promises to reduce carbon emissions and provide financial support for developing countries to adapt to global warming.  China's Vice Foreign Minister  also emphasized the fact that climate change was "a matter of survival" for developing countries, and accordingly, such countries need wealthier and more developed countries to accentuate not only their pledges of emissions reduction targets, but also their financial commitments under the aforementioned  United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  To that end, scientists and leaders of small island states in the Indian Ocean, the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, have highlighted  the existential threat posed by global warming and the concomitant rise in sea level.
China and India were joined by Brazil and South Africa in the crafting of a draft document calling for a new global climate treaty to be completed  by June 2010. Of concern has been the realization that there was insufficient time to find concurrence on a full legal treaty, which would leave countries only with a politically-binding text by the time the summit at Copenhagen closed. But Guyana's leader, President Bharrat Jagdeo, warned that the summit in Denmark would  be classified as a failure unless a binding document was agreed upon instead of just political consensus. He urged his cohorts to act with purpose saying, "Never before have science, economics, geo-strategic self-interest and politics intersected in such a way on an issue that impacts everyone on the planet."
Likewise, Tuvalu demanded that  legally binding agreements emerge from Copenhagen.  Its proposal was supported by many of the vulnerable countries, from small island states and sub-Saharan Africa, all of whom warned of  the catastrophic impact of climate change on their citizens.  Tuvalu also called for more aggressive action, such as  an amendment to the 1992 agreement, which would focus on sharp greenhouse gas emissions and the accepted rise in temperatures, due to the impact the rise in seas. The delegation from Kiribati joined the call by drawing attention to the fact that one village had to be abandoned due to waist-high water, and  more such effects were likely to follow.  Kiribati's Foreign Secretary, Tessie Lambourne, warned  that the people of Kiribati could well be faced with no homeland in the future  saying, "Nobody in this room would want to leave their homeland." But despite such impassioned pleas and irrespective of warnings from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  that the rise in sea level from melting polar ice caps would deleteriously affect low-lying atolls such as such as Tuvalu and Kiribati in the Pacific, and the Maldives in the Indian Ocean, the oil-giant Saudi Arabia was able to block this move.

By Dec. 12, 2009, details related to a draft document prepared by Michael Zammit Cutajar, the head of the Ad-hoc Working Group on Long-Term Cooperative Action, were released at the  Copenhagen climate conference.  Included in the document were calls for  countries to make major reductions in carbon emissions over the course of the next decade.  According to the Washington Post, industrialized countries were called on to make cuts of between 25 percent and 40 percent below 1990 levels -- reductions that were far more draconian than the United States was likely to accept.  As discussed above, President Obama had offered a provisional reduction target of 17 percent.  The wide gap between the released draft and the United States' actual stated position suggested there was much more negotiating in the offing if a binding agreement could be forged, despite the Obama administration's claims that it was seeking greater engagement on this issue.

The division between developed and developing countries in Copenhagen reached new heights on Dec. 14, 2009, when some of the poor and less developed countries launched a boycott at the summit. The move, which was spurred by African countries but backed by China and India,  appeared to be geared toward redirecting attention and primary responsibility to the wealthier and more industrialized countries.  The impasse was resolved after the  wealthier and more industrialized countries offered assurances that they did not intend on shirking from their commitments to reducing greenhouse gases.  As a result, the participating countries ceased the boycott.

Primer on parliamentary elections of 2010 in Tuvalu
A parliamentary election was scheduled to be held in Tuvalu on September 16, 2010. At stake were the 15 seats in the "Fale I Fono" or unicameral parliament, also called  the House of Assembly.  Typically, members of parliament are elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms, with all seats in the past held by independents.
Parliament was dissolved on August 13, 2010, ahead of the scheduled election date, and in preparation for the national elections.  Ahead of voting day, Prime Minister Apisai Ielemia led a caretaker government for one month.  Prime Minister Ielemia, who completed his first term in office, was hoping to stay on at the helm of government.
The outgoing Tuvalu government said that its priority for the future would be on the development of outer islands. Home Affairs Minister Willie Telavi noted that outer island development had been neglected in the past. Indeed, Tuvalu has been faced with significant geographical and financial challenges in delivering services to the eight atolls of Tuvalu.

Early election results indicated that  Prime Minister Apisai Ielemia was among ten sitting members of parliament re-elected to power.  Also re-elected to power were the incumbent ministers of finance, health and foreign affairs.

The prime minister would therefore seek to form a new coalition government before the end of the month.
But on September 22, 2010, five new members of parliament, who make up a full third of the legislative body, warned that the new government would not be reconstituted at the helm of the country. One such  member of parliament, Enele Sopoanga said, "There's no way that the former government will come back."  In an interview with PacNews, he continued, "There is going to be a change of government early next week and the horse trading for numbers have begun."  Whether or not the new government would include  Prime Minister Apisai Ielemia was yet to be determined.  Indeed, any new government would require the support of eight members of parliament.

Tuvalu Prime Minister Apisai Ielemia gained international cachet in 2009 when, in Copenhagen,  he lobbied for global action against the perils of climate change and the effects of the concomitant rise of sea levels on the lives of people living in small island nations.

On September 29, 2010, in the aftermath of the aforementioned elections and in an internal vote in parliament, it was former Prime Minister Matia Toafa and not Aposai Ielemia who was elected as the new head of government.  It was a reversal of fortune of sorts for the two politicians since Toafa had once lost his seat to Ielemia.  Toafa garnered nine votes in his favor, including five votes from the newly-elected members of parliament, who had signaled that they were in favor of a change in government.

Toafa was inaugurated into office right after the internal parliamentary vote by Governor General Iakopa Italeli Taeia.

In his first public interview with Radio Tuvalu, the new prime minister called on his cabinet to work on behalf of the people of Tuvalu. 

Meanwhile, all five of the new members of parliament were accorded key cabinet positions, including the portfolios for finance, which went to newcomer, Monise Laafai,  and health, which went to journalist, Sauoa Maani.  As well, former diplomat and climate change negotiator, Enele Sopoanga, was given the portfolio for foreign affairs, environment and labor.  All eight cabinet ministers were sworn into office following Prime Minister Toafa's inauguration.

Recent Developments

On Dec. 22, 2010, Tuvalu's parliament was dissolved following a no-confidence vote against Prime Minister Maatia Toafa.  The confidence motion passed successfully when one cabinet minister -- Willy Telavi -- crossed the floor to vote in favor of the motion.  There appeared to be a financial motivation for the vote with members of parliament concerned about the forthcoming budget and allocations for island development, medical treatment costs, and salaries of state workers.  Soon thereafter, nominations were taking place for possible successors to Toafa for the job of head of government.  To that end, the cross-over voter, Willy Telavi, was ultimately elected to take on the role of head of government.  Telavi,  a former police commissioner who held the post of Minister of Home Affairs in the cabinet of Prime Minister Toafa,  was elected on Dec. 24, 2010, defeating Foreign Affairs and Environment Minister Eneke Sopoaga  by a razor thin 8-7 vote.
Telavi's government was at risk more than two years later when at the start of July 2013, Tuvalu's opposition requested that the country's governor general use his special powers to reconvene parliament.  At issue was the result of a by-election that resulted in victory for an opposition candidate for a vacant seat in parliament.  That outcome essentially meant that the government lost its narrow parliamentary majority.  As such, the opposition wanted to have the parliamentary distribution of seats to be confirmed, potentially setting the scene for a no-confidence vote, which could oust the sitting government from power.  For his part, Tuvalu Prime Minister Willy Tevali has not been in a hurry to reconvene parliament given the fact that the government no longer commanded a parliamentary majority.  See below for details.

Parliamentary session in Tuvalu results in ousting of government and election of new PM

An important parliamentary session loomed ahead in Tuvalu, which was expected to decide the fate of the government of Prime Minister Willy Telavi.

At issue was a victory for the opposition in a by-election for a seat on Nukufetau Island  held in mid-June 2013, which offered the opposition the position to command a parliamentary majority.  Now the composition in parliament gave the government seven seats and the opposition eight seats.  Assuming the members of the parliament voted in lockstep with their blocs, such a distribution of parliamentary seats would set the path in motion to bring down the government of Prime Minister Willy Tevali. Anxious to test the possibility that it could form a new government, the opposition has been angling for a new parliamentary session in which it could bring forth a confidence vote.

At the start of July 2013, Tuvalu's governor general, Sir Lakoba Italeli, acquiesced to the calls from the opposition and ordered parliament to sit in session on July 30, 2013. It would be the first sitting of parliament since late December 2012 when the member of parliament passed a budget.  This session at the end of July 2013 would predictably include the introduction of a no-confidence motion by the opposition against the Tevali government.

It should be noted that Tuvalu's political scene has been marked by stalemate since late 2012 with the only productive bit of business done at the time was the passage of the budget, as noted above. Now, according to Opposition Spokesperson Taukalina Finikaso, it was way past time to shift the dynamics. As noted by Finikaso, "We have been in this uncertainty for quite a long period. It is seven months now and we cannot continue on like this without parliament meeting and without the nation knowing what is happening. So we think it is a very good decision by the governor general and I think he has done it in the spirit of the constitution and also the democratic nation of Tuvalu."

Now, with the parliamentary session looming ahead and a no-confidence vote in the offing, the opposition was expressing confidence that it was united and had the seats to command a majority.  Accordingly, Opposition Spokesperson  Finikaso believed that voting on the confidence measure would, therefore,  go its way.  Indeed, among the opposition ranks, there were high hopes that the vote would result in the toppling of the government and the formation of a new government. But the prime minister was equally confident that he had the support to defeat the no confidence motion, thanks to the support of a couple of cross-over votes,  and he would ultimately hold sway in command of the government.  Indeed, Prime Minister  Willy Telavi's stance appeared to be that of a man spoiling for a fight he was sure to win.  It was to be seen which side would prove to be correct.

Politically, the advantage seemed to be with the opposition at the start of August 2013. First, the government's faction in parliament was short at least one vote due to the death of Finance Minister Lotoala Metia in December 2012. Second, ill health of Education Minister Falesa Pitoi meant that the government would be short an additional member.  Third, the  pro-government faction in parliament was further diminished when Health Minister Taom Tanukale resigned from parliament.  But things moved in a decidedly dismal direction for those in power when Prime MInister Telavi's government lost a motion to dissolve parliament before the anticipated  vote of no confidence could be taken against them.

The scene in parliament turned dramatic when the opposition advanced its no-confidence vote in the Telavi government only to have Tuvalu's Speaker of Parliament refuse the motion and announced an adjournment.  Governor General Iakopa Italeli Taeia entered the fray and called for the parliament to meet and resume activity. This move sparked a  battle of wills between the prime minister and the governor general when Telavi said that he was removing Governor General Iakopa Italeli Taeia from his post as the head of state. Hours later,  however, Italeli said he was removing Prime Minister Telavi and his cabinet from office and appointing the opposition leader, Enele Sopoanga, as a caretaker prime minister. The scenario  had all the makings of a constitutional crisis.  But regardless of Telavi's claim on legitimacy, the fact of the matter was that the numbers in parliament favored the parliament.

Ultimately on Aug. 2, 2013, a majority of members of parliament supported the no-confidence motion and officially brought down Telavi's government.  Later in the parliamentary session,  Enele Sopoaga --  the opposition leader -- was elected to serve as the new prime minister.

Prime Minister Sopoanga soon unveiled his cabinet and the new government was sworn into power by the governor general, Sir Iakoba Italeli in Funafuti.  Included in the government was the deputy premier, Vete Sakaio, who would also be responsible for public utilities.  Former diplomat, Finikaso Taukelina, a former diplomat,  who would become the new minister for foreign affairs. Home Affairs, which was normally part of the prime minister's portfolio, would become a separate government ministry with Namoliku Sualiki at the helm. The health portfolio and the education portfolio were merged under one ministry to be headed by Fauoa Maani. The portfolio for finance and economic development would be held by Maatia Toafa, a former prime minister.  Meanwhile,  the portfolio for communication and transport, as well as the portfolio for natural resources, would be held by  Monisa Laafai and Elisala Pita respectively.

Note: It should be noted that irrespective of the inauguration of the new Tuvalu government, its legitimacy remained a matter of debate.  There was a court decision pending over the actions taken by both the governor general and the former prime minister, leading up to the installation of the new government.
Elections Note:

Parliamentary elections were set to be held on March 19, 2015, in Tuvalu; they were delayed (as discussed below) due to Cyclone Pam and ultimately held on March 31, 2015.  At stake was the composition of the unicameral parliament, also called the House of Assembly or "Fale I Fono."  In this body, the seats are occupied by members who are elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms.  There are no functional parties vying for control of the legislative chamber; instead, all members of parliament are political independents.

From 2010 to 2015, Tuvalu has seen a parade of prime ministers as rivalries, confidence motions, and political machinations have brought down one government after the other.  Since 2013, Enele Sopoaga has  served as the caretaker prime minister.  The Sopoaga government increased its majority in parliament over the course of 2014 as a result of two by-elections.  It was to be seen if the Sopoaga government  would win a mandate in the 2015 parliamentary contest.

But the answer to the question of who would lead the new Tuvalu government was left unanswered due to a weather crisis.  Cyclone Pam hit the islands of the south Pacific hard, with Tuvalu being among those particularly hard-hit. Indeed, Tuvalu's election was postponed due to the damage wrought by Cyclone Pam, which left the country in dire need of fresh water supplies and other forms of emergency assistance.

Voters finally went to the polls on March 31, 2015, and ultimately, most of the members of parliament were returned to power.  This result set the stage for  the government of Enele Sopoaga to return to power.  To that end, on April 10, 2015, it was announced officially that  Sopoaga was returned to power as Tuvalu's prime minister. In parliament he had a clear majority, given the support of 11 out of the 15 allied elected members of parliament.

Editor's Update:

Note that Tuvalu's election, scheduled to be held on March 19, 2015 as noted above,  was postponed due to the damage wrought by Cyclone Pam.  That cyclone hit the islands of the Pacific hard and  left Tuvalu in dire need of fresh water supplies and other forms of emergency assistance. 

Election of 2019:
Parliamentary elections were set to be held on Sept. 9, 2019 in Tuvalu.  At stake was the composition of the unicameral parliament, also called the House of Assembly or "Fale I Fono."  In this body, there are 16 seats occupied by members who are elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms.  There are no functional parties vying for control of the legislative chamber; instead, all members of parliament are political independents. 

Following these elections, once the composition of the House of Assembly was decided, an internal vote within the legislative chamber was carried out to determine the new head of government.  Kausea Natano won 10 of the 16 votes at stake and was inaugurated as the new prime minister on Sept. 19, 2019.

Environmental Note:

Small island countries announce plan to sue multinational fossil fuel corporations for their role in climate change --

In mid-2015, six small island nation states -- Vanuatu, Kiribati, Tuvalu, Fiji, Solomon Islands and  Philippines -- released a manifesto on climate change.  Dubbed the  "People's Declaration for Climate Justice,"  the declaration announced a plan to sue large multinational fossil fuel corporations, which they blamed for  carbon pollution,  the degradation to their ecosystems, and the other deleterious effects of climate change.

The highlights of the manifesto read as follows:  "We, the people of Vanuatu, Kiribati, Tuvalu, Fiji, Solomon Islands and the Philippines continue to experience the impacts of climate change - the single biggest human rights, environmental and humanitarian crisis of our time As the people most acutely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, we will not let the big polluters decide and assign our fate We commit to holding those most responsible for climate change accountable. By doing so, we send a message of hope that the people and not the polluters are in charge of humanity's destiny. "  In truth, the effort to sue the world's largest fossil fuel corporations would not be a simple endeavor and  the plaintiff nation states might not even see their day in court; however, small island countries were not willing to silently accept the pressing environmental threat to their existence without seeking accountability.

Editor's Entry on Environmental Policy:

Small island nations across the world are  vulnerable to the threats posed by global warming and cimate change, derived from carbon emissions, and resulting in the rise in sea level.  Political policy in the country is often connected to ecological issues, which have over time morphed into an existential crisis of sorts.

December 2012 saw climate talks in the Qatari city of Doha.  There, representatives from countries across the world gathered to discuss the fate of the Kyoto Protocol, which seeks to minimize greenhouse gas emissions.  The summit yielded results with  decisions made (1) to extend the Kyoto Protocol until 2020, and (2) for wealthier countries to compensate poorer countries for the losses and damage incurred as a result of climate change.

There was, in fact, little progress made on the central issue of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  Had those emissions been reduced, there would have been less of a need to financially deal with the devastation caused by climate change.  One interpretation was that the global community was accepting the fact that industrialization was contributing to global warming, which had deleterious effects on the polar ice caps  and concomitantly on the rise of sea level, with devastating effects for small island nations. Thus, wealthier countries were willing to pay around $10 billion a year through 2020, effectively in "damages," to the poor countries that could be viewed as the "collateral damage" of industrial progress.  But damages today could potentially be destruction tomorrow, leaving in place the existential challenges and burdens to be born by some of the world's smallest and least wealthy island countries.

Perhaps not surprisingly, the  representative for the small island nation states at the Doha summit responded with ire, characterizing the lack of progress on reducing emissions as follows: "We see the package before us as deeply deficient in mitigation (carbon cuts) and finance. It's likely to lock us on the trajectory to a 3,4,5C rise in global temperatures, even though we agreed to keep the global average temperature rise of 1.5C to ensure survival of all islands. There is no new finance (for adapting to climate change and getting clean energy) -- only promises that something might materialize in the future. Those who are obstructive need to talk not about how their people will live, but whether our people will live."

Indeed, in most small island countries not just in the Pacific, but also the Caribbean and Indian Ocean, ecological concerns and the climate crisis have been dominant themes with dire life and death consequences looming in the background for their people.  Small island nations in these region  are already at risk from the rise of sea-level, tropical cyclones, floods.  But  their very livelihoods of fishing and subsistence farming are also at risk as a result of ecological and environmental changes.  Of particular concern is the matter of  ocean acidification, which destroys  reefs and decimates fish and shellfish populations that provide protein for inhabitants.  At the same time, increasingly high storm surges can wipe out  coastlines, and even  entire villages, while

contaminating water supplies.  Accordingly, the very existence of islands are at severe risk of being obliterated from the map.  Yet even with the existential threat of being wiped off the map in the offing, the international community has been either slow or restrictive in its efforts to deal with global warming, climate change, economic and ecological damage, as well as the emerging global challenge of environmental refugees.

A 2012  report from the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the Pacific Regional Environment Program underlined the concerns of small island nations and their people as it concluded that the livelihoods of approximately 10 million people in Pacific island communities were increasingly vulnerable to climate change. In fact, low-lying islands in that region  would likely confront  losses of up to 18 percent of gross domestic product due to climate change, according to the report. The report covers 21 countries and territories, including Fiji, Kiribati,  Samoa and Tonga, and recommended  environmental legislation intended to deal with the climate crisis facing the small island countries particularly. As noted by David Sheppard, the director general of the Pacific Regional Environment Program that co-sponsored this study: "The findings... emphasize the need more than ever to raise the bar through collective actions that address the region's environmental needs at all levels."

Special Report

COP 21 summit in Paris ends with historic agreement to tackle climate change; rare international consensus formed on environmental crisis facing the planet --

In mid-December 2015, the highly-anticipated United Nations climate conference of parties (COP) in Paris, France, ended with a historic agreement.  In fact, it would very likely be understood as the most significant international agreement signed by all the recognized countries of the world since the Cold War.  Accordingly, the Paris Agreement was being distinguished as the first multilateral pact that would compel all countries across the world to cut its carbon emissions -- one of the major causes of increasing greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to global warming, and its deleterious effects ranging from the dangerous rise in sea level to catastrophic climate change.

The accord, which was dubbed to be the "Paris Agreement," was the work of rigorous diplomacy and fervent environmental advocacy, and it aimed to address the climate change crisis facing the planet.  As many as 195  countries were represented in the negotiations that led to the landmark climate deal.  Indeed, it was only after  weeks of passionate debate that  international concurrence was reached in addressing the environmental challenges confronting the world, with particular attention to moving beyond fossil fuels and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The success of the COP 21 summit in Paris and the emergence of the landmark Paris Agreement was, to some extent, attributed to the efforts of France's  Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius who presided over the negotiations.  The French foreign minister's experience and credentials as a seasoned diplomat and respected statesman paid dividends.  He skillfully guided the delegates from almost 200 countries and interest groups along the negotiations process, with ostensibly productive results and a reasonably robust deal to show for it.

On Dec. 12, 2015, French Foreign Minister Fabius officially adopted the agreement, declaring: "I now invite the COP to adopt the decision entitled Paris Agreement outlined in the document.  Looking out to the room I see that the reaction is positive, I see no objections. The Paris agreement is adopted."  Once Foreign Minister Fabius' gavel was struck, symbolically inaugurating the Paris Agreement into force, the COP delegate rushed to their feet with loud and bouyant cheers as well as thunderous applause.

In general, the Paris Agreement was being hailed as a victory for enviromental activists and a triumph for international diplomats, while at the same time being understood as simply an initial -- and imperfect -- move in the direction of a sustainable future.

China's chief negotiator, Xie Zhenhua, issued this  message, saying that while the accord was not ideal,  it should "not prevent us from marching historical steps forward."

United States President  Barack Obama lauded the deal as both "ambitious" and "historic,"  and the work of strenuous multilateral negotiations as he declared, "Together, we've shown what's possible when the world stands as one."  The United States leader acknowledged that the accord  was not "perfect," but he reminded the critics that it was "the best chance to save the one planet we have. "

Former United States Vice President Al Gore, one of the world's most well known environmental advocates, issued a lengthy statement on the accompishments ensconced in the Paris Agreement.  He highlighted the fact that the Paris Agreement was a first step towards a future with a reduced carbon footprint on Planet Earth as he said,  "The components of this agreement -- including a strong review mechanism to enhance existing commitments and a long-term goal to eliminate global-warming pollution this century -- are essential to unlocking the necessary investments in our future. No agreement is perfect, and this one must be strengthened over time, but groups across every sector of society will now begin to reduce dangerous carbon pollution through the framework of this agreement."

The central provisions of the Paris Agreement included the following items:

- Greenhouse gas emissions should peak as quickly as possible, with a move towards balancing energy sources, and ultimately the decrease of  greenhouse gases in the second half of this century
- Global temperature increase would be limited to 1.5 degrees Centigrade  above pre-industrial levels and would be held "well below" the  two degrees Centigrade threshold
-  Progress on these goals would be reviewed  every five years beginning in 2020 with new  greenhouse gas reduction targets issued every five years
- $100 billion would be expended each year in climate finance for developing countries to move forward with green technologies, with further climate financing to be advanced in the years beyond

It should be noted that there both  legally binding and voluntary elements contained within the Paris Agreement. Specifically, the  submission of an emissions reduction target and the regular review of that goal would be legally mandatory for all countries.  Stated differently, there would be a system in place by which  experts would be able to track the carbon-cutting progress of each country.  At the same time, the specific targets to be set by countries would be determined at the discretion of the countries, and would not be binding.  While there was some criticism over this non-binding element, the fact of the matter was that the imposition of emissions targets was believed to be a major factor in the failure of climate change talks in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 2009. 

In 2015, the talks faced challenges as several countries, such as China and India, objected to conditions that would stymie economic and development. In order to avoid that kind of landmine, a system Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) was developed and formed the basis of the accord. As such, the Paris Agreement would, in fact,  facilitate economic growth and development, as well as technological progress, but with the goal of long-term ecological sustainability based on low carbon  sources.  In fact, the agreement heralded as "the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel era."  As noted by Nick Mabey, the head of the climate diplomacy organization E3G, said, "Paris means governments will go further and faster to tackle climate change than ever before.  The transition to a low carbon economy is now unstoppable, ensuring the end of the fossil fuel age."

A particular sticking point in the agreement was the $100 billion earmarked for  climate financing for developing countries to transition from traditional fossil fuels to green energy technologies and a low carbon future.  In 2014, a report by the  International Energy Agency indicated that the cost of that transition would actually be around $44 trillion by the mid-century -- an amount that would render the $100 billion being promised to be a drop in the proverbial bucket.  However, the general expectation was that the Republican-controlled Senate in the United States, which would have to ratify the deal in that country, was not interested in contributing significant funds for the cause of climate change. 

A key strength of the Paris Agreement was the ubiquitous application of measures to all countries.  Of note was the frequently utilized concept of "flexibility" with regard to the Paris Agreement.  Specifically,  the varying capacities of the various countries in meeting their obligations would be anticipated and accorded flexibility.  This aspect presented something of a departure from the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which drew a sharp distinction between developed and developing countries, and mandated a different set of obligations for those categories of countries.  Thus, under Kyoto, China and India were not held to the same standards as the United States and European countries.

In the Paris Agreement, there would be commitments from all countries across the globe.

Another notable strength of the Paris Agreement was the fact that the countries of the world were finally able to reach consensus on the vital necessity to limit global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Centrigrade.  Ahead of the global consensus on the deal, and as controversy continued to surface over the targeted global temperature limits, the leaders of island countries were sounding the alarm about the melting of the Polar ice caps and the associated rise in seal level.  Prime Minister

Enele Sopoaga of Tuvalu issued this dismal reminder: "Tuvalu's future  is already bleak and any further temperature increase will spell the total demise of Tuvalu. No leader in this room carries such a level of worry and responsibility. Just imagine you are in my shoes, what would you do?"  It was thus something of a victory for environmental advocates that the countries of the world could find cnsensus on the lower number -- 1.5 degrees rather than 2 degrees.

A  significant weak point with regard to the Paris deal was a "loss and damage" provision, which anticipates that even with all the new undertakings intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and move to a low carbon future, there would nonetheless be unavoidable climate change consequences.  Those consequences ranged from the loss of arable land for farmers as well as soil erosion and contamination of potable water by sea water, to the decimation of territory in coastal zones and on small islands, due to the rise in sea level, with entire small island countries being rendered entirely uninhabitable.  The reality was that peoples' homes across the world would be destroyed along with their way of life.

With that latter catastrophic effect being a clear and present danger for small island countries, the  Association of Small Island States (AOSIS) demanded that the developed world acknowledge its responsibility for this irreversible damage..

Despite the fact that greenhouse gas emissions and the ensuing plague of global warming was, indeed, the consequence of development in the West (the United States and Europe) and the large power house countries, such as Russia, China and India,  there was no appetite by those countries to sign on to unlimited liability.  Under the Paris Agreement,  there was a call for  research  on insurance mechanisms that would address loss and damage issues, with recommendations to come in the future.

The call for research was being regarded as an evasion of sorts and constituted the weakest aspect of the Paris Agreement.  Not surprisingly, a coalition of small island nations demanded a "Marshall Plan" for the Pacific.  Borrowing the term "Marshall Plan" from the post-World War II reconstruction effort, the coalition of Pacific island nation, which included Kiribati, Tuvalu, Fiji, and the Marshall Islands, called for an initiative that would include investment in renewable energy and shoreline protection,  cultural preservation, economic assistance for economies in transition, and a plan for migration and resettlement for these countries as they confront the catastrophic effects of the melting of the Polar ice caps and the concomitant rise in sea level.  The precise contours of the initiative remained unknown, unspecified, and a mere exercise in theory at the time of writing.  Yet such an initiative would, at some point, have to be addressed, given the realities of climate change and the slow motion calamity unfolding each day for low-lying island nations across the world.

As noted by Vice President Greg Stone of  Conservation International, who also functions as  an adviser to the government of Kiribati, "Imagine living in a place where you know it's going to go away someday, but you don't know what day that wave's going to come over and wash your home away."  He added, "It's a disaster we know is going to happen."

Meanwhile, the intervening years promised to be filled with hardship for small island nations, such as Kiribati.  Stone explained, "For every inch of sea-level rise, these islands lose 10 feet of their freshwater table to saltwater intrusion," Stone explained. "So it's not just about the day the water finally goes over the island; it's also about the day that there's just not enough water left and everyone has to move off the island."  Presaging the future for island nations that could face submersion, Stone said, "If you look ahead 50 years, a country like Kiribati could become the first aqueous nation. possibility of migration. That is, they own this big patch of ocean, and they administer it from elsewhere."

Foreign Minister Minister Tony Debrum of the Marshall Islands emerged as the champion advocating on behalf of small island nation states and a loose coalition of concerned countries from the Pacific to the Caribbean, but with support from the United States.  He addressed the comprehensive concerns of small island nations regarding the weaknesses of the deal, while simultaneously making clear that the Paris Agreement signified hope for the countries most at risk.  In a formal statement, Debrum declared: "We have made history today. Emissions targets are still way off track, but this agreement has the tools to ramp up ambition, and brings a spirit of hope that we can rise to this challenge. I can go back home to my people and say we now have a pathway to survival."  Debrum highlighted the imperatives of Pacific island nations, saying, "Our High Ambition Coalition was the lightning rod we needed to lift our sights and expectations for a strong agreement here in Paris. We were joined by countries representing more than half the world. We said loud and clear that a bare-bones, minimalist agreement would not fly. We instead demanded an agreement to mark a turning point in history, and the beginning of our journey to the post-carbon era."

Debrum of the Marshall Islands espoused the quintessential synopsis of the accord and its effects for those most likely to be affected by climate change as he noted, "Climate change won't stop overnight, and my country is not out of the firing line just yet, but today we all feel a little safer."
Special Note Affecting Pacific Island Nations:
The impact of climate change as grounds for asylum --

In March 2018, New Zealand became the first country in the world to recognize the deleterious impact of climate change as grounds for asylum.  

Neighboring island nation states in the Pacific Ocean were experiencing the effects of climate change as an existential crisis.  The rise of sea level, the erosion of coastlines, and loss of potable water and soil needed for survival was impacting the viability of Pacific countries such as the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Kiribati, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, Palau, among others.  Some countries were expected to be wiped off the map by the end of the century, generating entire nations of environmental refugees. 

Environmental refugees do not enjoy protections under international law as  the 1951 Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees protects persons fleeing persecution, from war or violence and not environmental crisis.  Moreover, the people of environmentally affected countries often do not want to be classified as refugees anyway. 
Former President Anote Tong of Kiribati has emphasized that the people of his country, quite likely to be rendered geographically homeless within decades, wanted to "migrate with dignity."

Against this backdrop,  New Zealand -- led by its Labour Party government, backed by the Green Party --  became the first country in the world to recognize the deleterious impact of climate change as grounds for asylum.  Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced plans to create a special visa for Pacific Islanders rendered homeless and forced to relocate because of the rise of sea level.  The program would begin in a limited manner - with only 100 visas offered annually.  However, it would serve as a precedent of sorts, setting an example for other countries to follow and also offer assistance. 

As noted by former Prime Minister Helen Clark via Twitter, New Zealand already had in place "significant migrant quotas for citizens of its Pacific neighbours" as part of its good neighbor policy. The new visa program would build upon this foundation. 

At the international level, the move by New Zealand could encourage assistance by other countries irrespective of legal recognition of refugee status by the United nations, Moreover,  it is an extension of the

"Protection Agenda" which 109 countries endorsed in 2015, and which seeks to organize resources to help the people affected by catastrophic effects of climate change. 
Editor's Entry on Environmental Policy: 

The low-lying Pacific island nations of the world, including Kiribati, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, Fiji, among others, are  vulnerable to the threats posed by global warming and cimate change, derived from carbon emissions, and resulting in the rise in sea level.  Other island nations in the Caribbean, as well as poor countries with coastal zones, were also at particular risk of suffering the deleterious effects of climate change.

Political policy in these countries are often connected to ecological issues, which have over time morphed into an existential crisis of sorts.  Indeed,  ecological concerns and the climate crisis have  also been dominant themes with life and death consequences for the people of island nations in the Pacific.  Indeed, the very livelihoods of fishing and subsistence farming remain at risk as a result of ecological and environmental changes.

Yet even so, these countries are threatened by increasingly high storm surges, which could wipe out entire villages and contaminate water supplies.  Moreover, because these are low lying island nations, the sustained rise in sea level can potentially lead to the terrain of these countries being unihabitable at best, and submerged at worst.  Stated in plain terms, these countries are at severe risk of being obliterated from the map and their plight illuminates the emerging global challenge of environmental refugees.  In these manifold senses, climate change is the existential crisis of the contemporary era.

Since the time of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, there have been efforts aimed at extending the life of that agreement, with an eye on minimizing greenhouse gas emissions, and thus minimizing the effects of climate change.  Those endeavors have largely ended in failure, as exemplified by the unsuccessful Copenhagen talks in 2009 and the fruitless Doha talks in 2012 respectively.  The success of the COP 21 talks in France, with the adoption of the landmark Paris Agreement in 2015, was regarded as the first glimmer of hope.  Not only did the Paris Agreement signify the triumph of international diplomacy and global consensus, but it also marked the start of the end of the fossil fuel era, with the path forward toward a low carbon future reliant on greener technologies.  Most crucially, the Paris Agreement stood as the first significant response in recent times to the central challenge of climate change and its quotidian effects on the lives of real human beings across the world.

On Wine Clemens: Bordeaux responds to climate change

Wine makers recognized climate change years ago. Many vine growers have meticulous records dating back a hundred years. For them, global warming is not speculation, it is real and their livelihoods depend on responding to it.
When temperatures increase, alcohol-by-volume increases. Red wines that were 12% ABV 30 years ago today are 13.5% to 15% in Bordeaux. Viticulturists called for change in Bordeauxs very strict grape rules a decade ago. Research was initiated. Rules were modified.
Bernard Farges, president of the Bordeaux Wine Council, noted: Vignerons were worried. They felt that if nothing was done, in 40 years Bordeaux as we know it would not exist. It would be too alcoholic and not typical.
In January 2021, the Institut National de lOrigine et de la Qualité  the controlling organization  formally approved four new red and two new white grapes for Bordeaux. The reds: arinarnoa (tannat-cabernet sauvignon cross), castets (obscure Bordeaux variety), marselen (cabernet sauvignon-grenache cross), and touriga nacional. The whites: alvarinho and liliorila (chardonnay-baroque cross). You likely recognize touriga nacional, red wine of Portugal, and alvarinho, key grape in northern Portugal and northwestern Spain, found in vinho verde in addition to bottling as a varietal.
All tolerate warm weather. The vines are limited to 5% of a growers vineyard, and the wine cannot exceed 10% of a wine blend. Since regulations prohibit naming grapes on a Bordeaux label if they are less than 15% of a blend, you will not see the varieties on Bordeaux labels.
I am confident that even if these varieties dont work, we will continue to experiment. We need to do something before it is too late, Farges said.
Merlot and sauvignon blanc are most at risk. Harvesting of these grapes now occurs in August. Historically, those grapes were harvested between Sept. 10 and Oct. 10. According to research, by 2050 the two grapes, as they exist now, will be useless in Bordeaux.
The climate is changing, and one of the worlds bedrock wine regions must change with it.
