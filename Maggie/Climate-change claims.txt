President Barack Obama told reporters in his first news conference since being re-elected he will seek ways to address climate change --- another issue that has divided Democrats and Republicans in recent years and should continue to generate some interesting claims to test on the Truth-O-Meter.
Below are some abbreviated versions of past fact checks about the topic. Look for the complete fact checks at the PolitiFact online sites.

Rick Perry: Scientists are "questioning the original idea that manmade global warming is what is causing the climate to change. ... (It is) more and more being put into question."
The Republican governor from Texas has made it clear he doesn't believe that human beings are contributing to global warming, and he expounded on the issue in detail at a stop in New Hampshire during his short run for president in the 2012 race.
PolitiFact asked the Perry campaign for comment on this, but we didn't hear back. In response to similar questions from The Washington Post, the Perry campaign pointed to various writings questioning climate change. But the Post's report noted these writings were anecdotal and "not evidence of the groundswell of opposition suggested by Perry."
PolitiFact reviewed several reports on the subject. Each concluded that the emissions of greenhouse gases from human activity were a factor in global warming.
A 2010 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences --- the official publication of the United States National Academy of Sciences --- found that out of 1,372 climate researchers under review, approximately 97 percent to 98 percent of those actively publishing in the field said they believe human beings are causing climate change.
Perry's remarks give the impression that the science of global warming is in dispute, that some scientists feel one way, and some scientists feel another way. He says that skepticism is growing. In fact, our research shows that's not the case. PolitiFact found that there is solid consensus among the major scientific organizations and that the skeptics seem to be a small minority. PolitiFact rated his statement False.

Barack Obama says Texas wildfires are linked to climate change.
Obama ridiculed Texas Gov. Rick Perry in a September 2011 speech when the president said, "You've got a governor whose state is on fire denying climate change."
A White House spokesman defended Obama's remarks, saying there is a link between severe weather and climate change.
Historically, scientists have drawn a clear distinction between specific weather events and longer-range changes in climate, and that sentiment persists. The situation in Texas that Obama was referring to could be described as something broader than a specific weather event, and there is peer-reviewed evidence linking broader climate change in the American Southwest with the incidence of wildfires in the region.
The Texas state climatologist wrote around that time he believes climate change has had an effect in encouraging the current wildfires, but only as a modest contributing factor. This caution, combined with the difficulty of determining cause and effect in a system as complex as the Earth's atmosphere, led PolitiFact to rate Obama's claim Half True.

Tim Pawlenty: "The weight of the evidence (on global warming) is that most of it, maybe all of it, is because of natural causes ... it's fair to say the science is in dispute."
Pawlenty, the former Minnesota governor who was briefly in the race for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination, made these comments to The Miami Herald.
PolitiFact divided his statement into two parts:
1) Evidence points toward climate change being primarily a natural, rather than manmade, phenomenon.
2) The science about the causes of global climate change is in dispute.
Based on our research, there is very little dispute in the scientific community, especially among climate specialists, on whether climate change is primarily caused by natural or manmade forces. The majority of scientists polled feel human activity is the primary driver of climate change. Based on scientific studies, global warming over the past 50 years has been primarily driven by human activity.
Pawlenty's claims are both incorrect and misleading to the public, who may not be familiar with the science behind climate change. It is not "fair to say the science is in dispute," as if there are good arguments on both sides. Rather, there is significant scientific consensus that human beings are contributing to global warming. We rated his statement False.

Florida Wildlife Federation: Claims Ohio Gov. John Kasich says climate change is a problem.
The federation posted billboards around Tampa shortly before the 2012 Republican National Convention with this claim to boost their argument that climate change is a concern among some Republican leaders as well as Democrats.
PolitiFact checked with Kasich's staff to see whether the quote was accurate. Rob Nichols, the governor's spokesman, confirmed that it was taken from a speech Kasich made in May 2012 at a small energy conference in Columbus, Ohio.
But for context, Nichols said there is a little more to Kasich's thoughts on global warming.
"He has said this several times, but what is usually omitted is what is on the back-end of what he has said," Nichols said. "Each time he says it, he has added, 'How big is this? I don't know. Should we overreact to this? No.'"
PolitiFact Ohio rated the statement True.
