At least 85% of the global population has experienced weather events made worse by climate change, according to new research published Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change. Using machine learning to analyze and map more than 100,000 studies of events that could be linked to global warming, researchers paired the analysis with a well-established data set of temperature and precipitation shifts caused by fossil fuel use and other sources of carbon emissions. These combined findings — which focused on events such as crop failures, floods and heat waves — allowed scientists to make a solid link between rising temperatures and human activities. They concluded that global warming had already affected 80% of the world's land area. 
"We have a huge evidence base now that documents how climate change is affecting our societies and our ecosystems," said lead author Max Callaghan, researcher at the Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change in Germany. The study provides hard numbers to back up the lived experiences of people from New York City to South Sudan. "Climate change," Callaghan said, "is visible and noticeable almost everywhere in the world." The findings come amid a major push to get countries to commit to more ambitious climate goals ahead of a United Nations summit in Glasgow next month. Research shows that existing pledges will put the planet on track to heat up about 2.7 degrees Celsius (4.9 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century — a level of warming that would lead to drastic food and water shortages, deadly weather disasters and catastrophic ecosystem collapse. Some of the world's top emitters, including China and India, have yet to formally commit to a new 2030 emissions reduction target. Activists worry that an emerging energy crisis, which has raised prices and triggered blackouts, could imperil efforts to get developing economies to phase out polluting fuels. In United States, climate disasters have already caused at least 388 deaths and more than $100 billion in damage this year, according to analyses from The Washington Post and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Yet despite a pledge to halve emissions by the end of the decade, congressional Democrats are struggling to pass a pair of bills that would provide hundreds of billions of dollars for renewable energy, electric vehicles and programs that would help communities adapt to a changing climate. The contrast between the scope of climate disasters and the scale of global ambition is top of mind for hundreds of protesters who have descended on Washington this week to demand an end to fossil fuel use. The activists, many of them from Indigenous communities that have been harmed by global warming, risked arrest as they remained on the sidewalk outside the White House after police ordered them to clear the area. The new research in Nature adds to a growing body of evidence that climate change is already disrupting human life on a global scale. Scientists are increasingly able to attribute events like heat waves and hurricanes to human actions. In August, the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change devoted an entire chapter to extreme weather consequences of a warming world. The study's conclusion that 85% of humanity is experiencing climate impacts may sound high. But it's "probably an underestimation," said Friederike Otto, a senior lecturer at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment at Imperial College, who was not involved in the study. The study looked at average temperature and precipitation changes, rather than the most extreme impacts, for which Otto says there is an even more evidence of climate change's role. "It is likely that nearly everyone in the world now experiences changes in extreme weather as a result of human greenhouse gas emissions," she said. The human toll of these events has become impossible to ignore. This summer, hundreds of people in the Pacific Northwest died after unprecedented heat baked the usually temperate region. More than a million people in Madagascar are at risk of starvation as a historic drought morphs into the a climate-induced famine. Catastrophic flooding caused New Yorkers to drown in their own homes, while flash flooding inundates refugee camps in South Sudan. In a letter released Monday, some 450 organizations representing 45 million health-care workers called attention to the way rising temperatures have increased the risk of many health issues, including breathing problems, mental illness and insect-borne diseases. One of the papers analyzed for the new study, for example, found that deaths from heart disease had risen in areas experiencing hotter conditions. "The climate crisis is the single biggest health threat facing humanity," the letter said. Yet in many of the places that stand to suffer most from climate change, Callaghan and his colleagues found a deficit of research on what temperature and precipitation could mean for people's daily lives. The researchers identified fewer than 10,000 studies looking at climate change's effect on Africa, and about half that number focused on South America. By contrast, roughly 30,000 published papers examined climate impacts in North America. In poorer countries, the researchers say, roughly a quarter of people live in areas where there have been few impact studies, despite strong evidence that they are experiencing shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns. In wealthier countries, that figure stands at only 3%. "But it indicates that we're not studying enough," Callaghan said, "not that there isn't anything happening."

STOCKHOLM — Three scientists won the Nobel Prize in physics Tuesday for work that found order in seeming disorder, helping to explain and predict complex forces of nature, including expanding our understanding of climate change. Syukuro Manabe, originally from Japan, and Klaus Hasselmann of Germany were cited for their work in developing forecast models of Earth's climate and "reliably predicting global warming." The second half of the prize went to Giorgio Parisi of Italy for explaining disorder in physical systems, ranging from those as small as the insides of atoms to the planet-sized. 
Hasselmann told The Associated Press that he "would rather have no global warming and no Nobel Prize.'' Manabe said that figuring out the physics behind climate change was "1,000 times" easier than getting the world to do something about it. He said the intricacies of policy and society are far harder to fathom than the complexities of carbon dioxide interacting with the atmosphere, which then changes conditions in the ocean and on the land, which then alters the air again in a constant cycle. He called climate change "a major crisis." The prize comes less than four weeks before the start of high-level climate negotiations in Glasgow, Scotland, where world leaders will be asked to ramp up their commitments to curb global warming. The Nobel-winning scientists used their moment in the limelight to urge action. "It's very urgent that we take very strong decisions and move at a very strong pace" in tackling global warming, Parisi said. He made the appeal even though his share of the prize was for work in a different area of physics. All three scientists work on what are known as "complex systems," of which climate is just one example. But the prize went to two fields of study that are opposite in many ways, though they share the goal of making sense of what seems random and chaotic so that it can be predicted. Parisi's research largely centers around subatomic particles, predicting how they move in seemingly chaotic ways and why, and is somewhat esoteric, while the work by Manabe and Hasselmann is about large-scale global forces that shape our daily lives. The judges said Manabe, 90, and Hasselmann, 89, "laid the foundation of our knowledge of the Earth's climate and how human actions influence it." Starting in the 1960s, Manabe, now based at Princeton University, created the first climate models that forecast what would happen as carbon dioxide built up. Manabe is such a pioneer that other climate scientists called his 1967 paper with the late Richard Wetherald "the most influential climate paper ever," said NASA chief climate modeler Gavin Schmidt.

Your children may have questions about the changing climate. Many are hearing about or experiencing climate-change-fueled disasters such as wildfires and severe storms. Climate change affects everyone, but it impacts kids the most. Children are especially vulnerable to environmental health harms because they are still growing and have higher exposure to air, food and water based on weight. 
While the climate crisis can feel like an overwhelming topic, there are healthy ways to talk with kids about it. We can communicate in a way that is honest, hopeful, developmentally appropriate, and action oriented. By helping kids understand the issue of climate change and how it affects their health and futures, we empower them to make a difference. For toddlers and children under 5, it's a perfect time to introduce them the joys of nature. Parents may take walks to show how weather affects nature. Talk about how weather makes the seasons. You can point out bird nests, for example, and talk about how weather influences when and where birds make their nests. Talk about other wild animals and discuss how they all have homes that need protecting. Young children also enjoy gardening. Pick out fruit, vegetable or flower seeds to plant in your garden, or herbs to plant in kitchen boxes. Young children can help take care of plants, and get excited seeing something grow from nothing. Talk about how your child needs air to breathe and so do plants and animals. When pollutants get in the air, that affects their health. Point out local effects of climate change depending on your location. Some areas may be more prone to wildfires, hurricanes and floods, while others may experience longer and more intense heat waves or an increase in illness from mosquitoes and ticks. As children grow older, parents may begin explaining concepts behind climate change in simple scientific terms. Ask children what they know and fill in blanks or research it together. NASA has online resources to help parents go through each aspect of climate change. Families may also discuss how personal choices can affect the environment and show respect for nature. Calculate your family's carbon footprint together and ask them how they suggest lowering it. Examples might include turning lights off after leaving the room, biking or walking or taking public transit or carpooling when possible. Families may choose to eat a more plant-based diet. Explain how people — including kids — can be powerful forces in protecting the environment. Point out that choices we make can help make our planet, and people, healthier. Because teens are more aware of how issues may influence all aspects of their lives, you can discuss how climate change affects our economy and society. This can spark scientific curiosity and introduce the idea of civic responsibility. Pick a recent or ongoing event and discuss how climate change might have contributed to the event and its economic effects. For example, families can talk with their teen about how climate change is causing longer and more severe wildfires in California, resulting in the loss of homes and businesses. Discuss how it is also causing air pollution that forces people indoors. Consider the mental health effects all of this can have on families. Families might also explore how climate change doesn't affect everyone equally, and the ways some communities experience more health risks. Discuss how everyone should have an equal opportunity to clean air and water. Encourage your teen to come up with solutions and creative ways to express their ideas. They might use a science class presentation or a school, Scouts, 4-H or other project to educate peers about the need for climate change solutions. They could also form a club at school and brainstorm how to help the local community, write for a local or state newspaper on why teens care about the climate or join a national youth advocacy organization. Work together to make changes at home, incorporating your teen's ideas. Participate in advocacy as a family and pace your discussions to help prevent stress and anxiety. When disasters such as wildfires and hurricanes happen, be sure to limit your child's media use to cut down on the amount of distressing footage they see and hear on the news. Take nature breaks when possible. When you talk with your child, stay hopeful and focused on solutions. We have tools to take climate action right now, remind them, and these can have immediate benefits for our health. Even if the climate crisis is accelerating, emphasize that together we can clean up our air and water and reduce our carbon footprint. Parents are role models and can think about ways to advocate for a healthier environment for children. They can ask the school district to incorporate a climate curriculum, share news of climate advocacy work and reach out to local, state and federal legislators to encourage climate action. Kids are the next generation of innovators and thinkers. Youth leadership is already making a huge difference. If we nurture a love for the environment early, children may just come up with the best solutions. Don't be surprised if they teach you something, too, along the way. * Dr. Steph Lee is a pediatrician, preventive medicine specialist and spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics.

If you're like us, when the tornado warnings go out across southern Illinois, do you wonder: Is this one more symptom of climate change? That's impossible to answer with any precision. We have had tornadoes and stormy weeks before. 
It's hard to pinpoint what drives a single weather event. But what is clear is that extreme weather — the record heat waves, wildfires and unprecedented flooding that have ravaged the globe this summer — is a hallmark of this undeniable change. Climate change is not some distant threat; it is here. And the impact of it is only going to get worse. It's going to get worse even if we do something about it. All we're left with now is to minimize how much worse it gets. If we do nothing or next to nothing, if we continue to kid ourselves that it's just part of the natural ebb and flow of the planet's weather, well, then it will become a catastrophe. If we all have not been alarmed by the extreme weather so far in 2021, we should be by the report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It warns that world leaders must act immediately to reduce human reliance on fossil fuels or risk significant growth of extreme weather events. But this is not just a matter for world leaders and politicians. It is an existential challenge that calls on all of us to do our parts. Some responses will be easy. Some will be hard. All must be done. We must reduce the flow of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and we must make wise choices in how we adapt to the climate change that already has been set in motion. The U.N. panel said scientists are observing irrefutable climate changes in every region of the planet. "Many of the changes observed in the climate are unprecedented in thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of years, and some of the changes already set in motion, such as continued sea level rise, are irreversible over hundreds to thousands of years," they said. Left unchecked, these changes will affect virtually everything about human life as well as the lives of other animals who share the planet with us: our water and food supplies, sea levels, where and how we live, our health, our economies, virtually everything. "We just barely have the time," says Illinois congressman Sean Casten. "Our moment is right now to do what's necessary." We can pretend no longer.

Climate change is not some distant threat, it is here. And the impact of it is only going to get worse. It's going to get worse even if we do something about it. All we're left with now is to minimize how much worse it gets. If we do nothing or next to nothing, if we continue to kid ourselves that it's just part of the natural ebb and flow of the planet's weather, well, then it will become a catastrophe. If we all have not been alarmed by the extreme weather so far in 2021, we should be by the report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It warns that world leaders must act immediately to reduce human reliance on fossil fuels or risk significant growth of extreme weather events. But this is not just a matter for world leaders and politicians. It is an existential challenge that calls on all of us to do our parts. Some responses will be easy. Some will be hard. All must be done. We must reduce the flow of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and we must make wise choices in how we adapt to the climate change that already has been set in motion. The U.N. panel said scientists are observing irrefutable climate changes in every region of the planet. "Many of the changes observed in the climate are unprecedented in thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of years, and some of the changes already set in motion, such as continued sea level rise, are irreversible over hundreds to thousands of years," they said. Left unchecked, these changes will affect virtually everything about human life as well as the lives of other animals who share the planet with us: Our water and food supplies, sea levels, where and how we live, our health, our economies, virtually everything. "We just barely have the time," says Illinois congressman Sean Casten. "Our moment is right now to do what's necessary." We can pretend no longer.

Peggy Notebaert museum exhibit drives home climate change
Climate change can be hard for people to understand because humans are adaptable. But other life-forms aren't so lucky.
"We don't have to shiver or pant, we can just change the AC," said Steve Sullivan, senior curator of urban ecology for the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum. "Other species can't do that. Change from a biological standpoint is impossible for most organisms. If this summer is half a degree warmer, climatologists are going to freak out but homeowners won't notice a difference."
The museum is helping to educate visitors on the causes and effects of climate change, and how they can help, through the exhibit "Weather to Climate: Our Changing World," which runs in Chicago through Oct. 23 before heading out on tour.
"Climate change is really the defining issue of our time, and we saw that as an issue that we as an institution could address," Sullivan said. "We also noticed that a lot of museums rent traveling exhibits that address pressing issues, but oddly there are no really good, moderately sized traveling exhibits on climate change."
The exhibit opens by explaining the difference between weather and climate, letting kids play dress up in front of a mirror to see how their clothes may change frequently, like the weather. But climate — like a person's wardrobe — is typically consistent over time, depending on where you live. Residents of Hawaii, for example, might wear heavy jackets on occasion, but their overall wardrobe will be lighter than if they lived in Chicago.
"If you look at the political debate, a lot of times we conflate weather and climate," Sullivan said. "The weather you are experiencing at this moment is a data point. It's really kind of irrelevant. That collection of data points that are studied over 30 years equals a meaningful climate data point. When we look at that overall picture, not just what's happening today or yesterday, is when we can really see what's going on."
Kids can also take on the role of a meteorologist, donning suit jackets, standing in front of a green screen in a mock television studio and reading weather reports off a teleprompter while they see themselves amid graphics.
"At the most superficial level you're just interacting with this goofy, fun thing and seeing pictures of weather," Sullivan said. "At the most sophisticated level the text is informing the audience of how weather and climate are changing and how this affects people."
The middle section of the exhibit addresses the effects of climate change using mounted specimens of red and gray squirrels as an example.
Kids can also spin a wheel of fortune showing different animals and weather conditions they could be exposed to. A video then explains the potential effects. For instance the pika, a miniature rabbit with short ears, lives in high elevations and wouldn't mind colder temperatures. But pikas — who spend cold months eating stores of hay — would not get enough food to survive the winter if it was too wet.
"These specific plants and animals are adapted to specific climactic regimes," Sullivan said. "As those climates change, those animals may be able to adapt, they may be able to move. But most things that have to adapt to change in the world simply go extinct."
The exhibit ends by exploring how humans are impacting climate change. A sculpture incorporates 94 balls, each filled with a cubic foot of air to represent the amount of carbon dioxide the average American puts out in a day through the burning of fossil fuels.
By following tips for reducing their carbon footprint, visitors can help prevent climate change from getting worse.
"We want to end on a note that empowers people and, importantly, we want to end on a positive note that makes them feel like they can make a difference," Sullivan said.

WASHINGTON — Internal changes to a draft Defense Department report de-emphasized the threats climate change poses to military bases and installations, muting or removing references to climate-driven changes in the Arctic and potential risks from rising seas, an unpublished draft obtained by The Washington Post reveals. The earlier version of the document, dated December 2016, contains numerous references to "climate change" that were omitted or altered to "extreme weather" or simply "climate" in the final report, which was submitted to Congress in January 2018. While the phrase "climate change" appears 23 separate times in the draft report, the final version used it just once. Those and other edits suggest the Pentagon has adapted its approach to public discussion of climate change under President Donald Trump, who has expressed doubt about the reality of a phenomenon that scientists agree presents an increasing danger to the planet. While military leaders have said they see a changing climate as a driver of instability worldwide, they have also sought to stay out of a politically charged debate about its causes. Heather Babb, a Pentagon spokeswoman, declined to comment on the draft report, which outlines the results of the department's first survey of officials at different installations about the effects of climate change. 
The Post was not able to verify who made the changes reflected in the two documents. "As highlighted in the report, the effects of climate are a national security issue with potential impacts to missions, operational plans, and installations," Babb said in a statement. "DOD continues to focus on ensuring its installations and infrastructure are resilient to a wide range of threats, including climate. The Department has a proven record of planning and preparing for such threats." According to John Conger, who served as a senior Pentagon official under the Obama administration and was among the officials who initiated the multi-base survey that forms the basis of the report, employees from a dozen different Defense Department offices could have made changes to the text as it made its way through the bureaucracy's clearance process, which often makes for "lowest common denominator" documents. Conger said the alterations "change the feeling of urgency in the report, but not its fundamental conclusion — that our military installations are clearly experiencing climate impacts." The final document, a 32-page report to Congress, was published more than a year after the earlier draft. It, like its earlier version, finds that out of more than 3,500 military sites around the world, 782 reported being affected by drought, 763 by major wind events, and 706 by flooding, along with other problems — results that drew considerable attention when they debuted in late January. But the December 2016 draft was far more direct in its discussion of climate change and in particular the issue of sea-level rise — a well-known problem facing many military sites in coastal areas, from the sprawling naval base in Norfolk to the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site in the Pacific's remote Marshall Islands. Seas are currently rising by about 3.2 millimeters per year, and scientists fear the rise could accelerate in coming decades. The final Pentagon document even omits, in several cases, the simple observation that learning about bases' vulnerability to sea-level rise was a core part of the survey that is the subject of the report. That survey itself asked each military site how much of its area was located at elevations between 0-3, 0-6, 0-9, or 0-12 feet above sea level. The final document also removes a map showing "those sites that indicated possible effects could occur due to increased mean sea level between 0-3 feet." (A few references to sea-level rise do remain in the final version of the report and in the survey questions themselves, contained in an appendix.) "The wordsmithing, not saying ‘climate,' I could live with that," said Dennis McGinn, a retired Navy vice admiral who served as assistant secretary of the Navy for energy, installations and environment in the Obama administration, when some of the changes were described to him. "But taking out ... maps of critical areas of flooding, that's pretty fundamental. And the Arctic, that's huge, for a lot of reasons, not just for Department of Defense, but for the Coast Guard, and commercial shipping business." The report emerged from a process commenced by the previous administration, as officials in Washington sought to get a sense of how climate-related phenomena could affect military installations dotting the globe. President Barack Obama's focus on climate change created a sense of urgency for federal agencies, including the behemoth Defense Department, to prepare for its effects. The published version removes a reference to the National Climate Assessment, which the U.S. government, by law, undertakes every four years. It also omits several references to the decline of Arctic sea ice, an ongoing phenomenon that has been strongly attributed to climate change. One such case is found in a description of conditions at the Cape Lisburne radar station on Alaska's North Slope. A statement that "the past decades have seen a climate-related downward trend in the extent of Arctic sea ice coverage" does not appear in the final report, nor does a description of extreme weather events being "made more destructive by a reduction in sea ice and an increase in ice free periods," since without protective sea ice, large waves can pummel fragile Arctic coastlines during storms. And where the draft report says that shoreline erosion at the site is caused by "reduced sea ice coverage," the final document instead blames the damage on "sea ice fluctuations." In another omitted section, the draft document addresses ways in which a changing climate could affect the ability to train troops. "The changing climate could increase risk to the 420 endangered species that live on our installations, potentially leading to training and operating restrictions," the omitted section reads. "Increased high-heat days limit the training and testing activities our personnel can safely perform without appropriate rest periods," it continues. The survey at the center of the report, in its various versions, asked military installations a battery of detailed questions about different extreme events that have affected them, along with requesting information about installations' elevation and vulnerability to sea level rise. Among the questions asked were: — "Has your installation been negatively impacted by wind?" — "Has your installation been negatively impacted by extreme hot or cold temperatures?" — "What might be negatively impacted/degraded with an increase of 0 to 12 feet in mean sea level?" Current and former officials said that the wording and content of the report was unlikely to have a bearing on how the military services respond — or do not respond — to climate change. In some ways, the military has been seen as proactive in its attitude to climate issues, seeking to protect infrastructure in places such as Norfolk from changing weather, producing a massive climate change "road map" and planning for changes in the Arctic. In other ways, however, the military has taken only modest action as it operates its massive network of power-intensive bases and air, ship and vehicle fleets, and provides food and housing to its personnel around the world. "I think in DOD, there is generally a belief, it's more important what you do than to fight about how you talk about it," said Jeffrey Marqusee, a former director of environmental and energy research and development at the office of the secretary of defense. "It's not like they've generally been in denial mode," said Sherri Goodman, who served as deputy undersecretary of defense for environmental security in the Clinton administration. "They've generally been pretty forthcoming."

I'm having a hard time coping with scary climate change news. What should I do?

I'm having a hard time coping with scary climate change news. What should I do? Dear Sara: I recently read the climate change report out of Australia — "Existential climate-related security risk: A scenario approach" — and I am having a hard time coping with its implications. I'm in my late 20s, I work for a consulting group that helps companies switch to clean energy sources, and I am typically an optimistic person. I know that our world is not in a good place, but I have always been hopeful that by working together we will find a way to fix it. 
After reading this piece, though, I do not know what to do. Assuming it's true that human civilization as we know it could very likely come to an end by 2050, it's hard to focus on staying positive. How can we fight against the economic and political systems in place in the U.S. so that we get results, instead of feeling resigned to the way things are now? How do we stay positive here? I'm not sure if that's a question or a cry for help, but I hope there is a good question in there. — Courtney in New York City Dear Courtney, My answer might seem contradictory at first, so bear with me. I don't find that Australian report very credible. But I also think you're right to fear for the future. And it's worth taking steps to address that feeling — more on that in a bit. About that Australian climate change report For readers who missed it, in May 2019, an Australian think tank published an 11-page paper by former fossil fuel executive Ian Dunlop and book author David Spratt. In their paper, Dunlop and Spratt outline a scenario in which the world does not swiftly reduce global warming pollution. By 2050, in their scenario, coral reefs and the Amazon ecosystem collapse, deadly heat displaces more than 1 billion people, and food prices skyrocket. Dire social consequences ensue, including armed conflict, pandemics, and outright chaos. The paper, which was not peer-reviewed, provoked immediate criticism from climate scientists, who challenged both the report and resulting news articles claiming that human civilization could end within 30 years. "This is a classic case of a media article overstating the conclusions and significance of a non-peer-reviewed report that itself had already overstated (and indeed misrepresented) peer-reviewed science," climate scientist Richard Betts, head of climate impacts at the Met Office Hadley Centre, wrote in a critique of a news article on the paper. "(T) he report's authors have merely read (or possibly seen without actually reading) a few of the scariest papers they could find, misunderstood (or not read properly) at least one of them, and presented unjustified statements," Betts said. Penn State scientist Michael Mann — who has endured intense harassment over his work on climate change — also called the think tank report exaggerated. "I respect the authors and appreciate that their intentions are good, but as I have written before, overblown rhetoric, exaggeration, and unsupportable doomist framing can be counteractive to climate action," he told NewScientist. You can read more about the controversy over the Australian paper in this Vox explainer: "Is climate change an ‘existential threat' — or just a catastrophic one?" The case for worrying about the climate Even if you don't buy the idea that civilization is going to outright collapse, there is plenty of mainstream, peer-reviewed research indicating that climate change is likely to cause enormous suffering this century. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the organization of scientists that issues periodic reports on climate science, is sometimes accused of being too conservative in its assessments. But even a recent IPCC report warns that an additional 0.5 degree Celsius of warming — on top of the roughly 1 degree the world has already warmed — could kill 70-90% of the world's coral reefs, cause annual global fish catches to fall by 1.5 million tons, and increase the risks to "health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security, and economic growth." And according to the IPCC, warming the planet by an additional 0.5 degree C is actually the best-case scenario. Unless the world cuts global warming pollution swiftly — by about 45% below 2010 levels by 2030 and to net zero by 2050 — the planet is likely to warm by more than 0.5 degree C, unleashing even more harm to people and the global community of species. Yikes! Courtney, you asked how to stay positive in light of frightening information about the climate. What if you … didn't? What would happen if you allowed yourself to feel the full force of your fear, sorrow, anger, or despair? "Respect and honor your feelings," said Margaret Klein Salamon, who holds a doctoral degree in clinical psychology and is the author of Facing the Climate Emergency, a book due out next spring. She is also the executive director of The Climate Mobilization, a nonprofit calling for a World War II-scale mobilization to rapidly slash global warming pollution. "They make sense. They are based in reality. They are based in your love for this world and for humanity." "You want to be a robot who doesn't care that all life is threatened? Hell, no," she said. Trebbe Johnson, the author of Radical Joy for Hard Times, also encourages acceptance of despair and grief about environmental destruction. "Recognize that you can't always change things in the moment," she said. "That kind of acceptance does not mean submission or capitulation. It simply means that you ground yourself in what is, so that you can move to the next step." So what is that next step? Consider these suggestions. Get informed, but recognize the psychological toll Patrick Houston, an organizer with New York Communities for Change, recently helped pass a bill to slash climate pollution associated with buildings in New York City. He said the first step to coping with climate despair is to learn more about the issue. He acknowledged that staying up-to-date with climate news can be daunting: "That comes at the emotional cost of constantly reading about the terrible situation that we've gotten ourselves into and how we're digging the hole deeper," he said. So he suggested choosing just one source to follow consistently. One option: InsideClimate News, the Pulitzer Prize-winning news site focusing on climate and energy. Houston also recommended identifying your elected officials at the local, state, and federal level. What do they say about climate change? Votesmart.org is one place to research a politician's stance on the issue. Connect with others Salamon said it's common for people who are knowledgeable about climate change to feel alienated from others. They might experience thoughts like, "No one understands. No one wants to talk about it. I'm kind of sitting here all alone with this horrible information." Not true. Nearly 70% of American adults are worried about climate change, making it a mainstream concern. Try talking about your fears with friends, family, or people in your community who are working to address the problem. "There is true relief in the fellowship of others who understand and who are grieving," Salamon said. Commit to action The next step, Houston said, is civic engagement. It's can be easy to feel cynical about U.S. politics. But Houston said it's important for people to understand that elected officials do in fact pay close attention to their constituents. "Some of those small actions that might not feel like a lot — sending a letter, signing onto a letter, calling your elected official, standing in the street for a rally or protest — even if it doesn't feel like a lot, they should know that elected officials pay a lot of attention to that, even if they don't always listen," he said. His other advice: Volunteer at a level that you can sustain over time. Many people can find time to get involved with one organization, but not a dozen. "It can be less overwhelming if you're just zoned in and focused on one goal rather than freaking out and trying to address every single part of the climate crisis by spreading yourself thin and volunteering with a bunch of different organizations," he said. Seek reasons for hope "What we're dealing with is horrible, but it is calling on us to be better," Salamon said. She said she takes inspiration from reading about how Americans responded to World War II. After the shocking attack on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. rapidly transformed its economy to produce goods for the war effort. People grew vegetables in victory gardens. Gasoline, meat, sugar, and other commodities were rationed, "which by and large Americans accepted cheerfully as part of the war effort," she said. There are advantages to that kind of mentality, she said: "It's actually a much better way of living to be working with your neighbors and your whole society for a common purpose." And unlike the case of a world war, she added, "This time, we don't need to kill anybody." * Sarah Kennedy contributed reporting.

Climate change endangers bird habitats, then birds

We found a highly unlikely bird last month during the Christmas Bird Count at Cantigny — a Nashville warbler. The species migrates through our region in the spring and early fall, and during those times it's pretty easy to spot one. But after October? Good luck with that.
So what was a Nashville warbler doing here on Dec. 19? And what about the painted bunting that caused a media sensation in New York City, also in December?
The knee-jerk response to these questions might be two words: climate change. Or an even better guess: El Nino. But cases of misplaced birds are nothing new. Storms and strong winds are often to blame, or sometimes a bird's internal compass just goes haywire. Birds get lost.
That said, warmer conditions may cause a wayward bird to stay put in the same place for days or weeks, assuming it locates a food source. It learns to adjust.
Indeed, the ability of birds to adapt to new environmental conditions is one of their key strengths. That's the good news. The bad news is that global warming in the decades ahead will test their resourcefulness like never before.
In November I went to hear a talk about the effects of climate change on birds in the Chicago region. The speaker was Doug Stotz, a conservation ecologist and ornithologist at the Field Museum in Chicago. He's also the co-chairman of the Chicago Wilderness Climate Change Task Force.
"The great thing about climate change is that it makes our winters warmer," Stotz said. "It's hard, as a Chicagoan, not to think that's a good idea."
Yes, I think we could all agree that ditching the down-filled parkas and flannel-lined jeans would be OK. And what birder around here would not enjoy some traditionally southern or southwest species moving into our region as average temperatures climb?
We know it's wrong, but it's hard to stop visions of painted buntings and scissor-tailed flycatchers from dancing in our heads. A few southern beauties are already here.
"Blue grosbeak, summer tanager and yellow-throated warbler are birds that didn't use to breed in the Chicago area, but they do now," Stotz said.
But whatever advantages climate change may hold for shivering Chicagoans and thrill-seeking birders, Stotz made one thing perfectly clear: Global warming is not good for most birds. The science tells us so.
In 2014, the National Audubon Society unveiled a seven-year study on the predicted impact of climate change on North American bird populations.
Out of 588 species studied, 314 were deemed at risk from global warming by 2080. For many, according to Audubon's climate model, the "gathering storm" will come sooner. To survive, the birds must adapt to losing huge portions of their current living areas.
Stotz cited the bobolink, a grassland species that even now struggles to prosper in the Chicago region. Climate change is shifting the bird's range northward. By 2050, he said, "Bobolinks are going to be in what is now boreal forest. It seems unlikely that will work."
Of the 314 at-risk species identified by Audubon, 126 are classified as "climate endangered," meaning they are projected to lose more than 50 percent of their current range by 2050 if global warming continues at its current pace.
Even common birds not listed in the Audubon study could vanish from our region due to climatic stress. The black-capped chickadee, Stotz said, could vacate Illinois, moving north as temperatures rise.
Avian visitors we look forward to seeing only in winter may no longer "drop down." If you are lucky enough to see a redpoll, a crossbill or northern shrike this winter, savor the experience. Spotting these and other species in the Chicago region may become significantly more challenging.
Sorry, that's the birder in me coming out again. Climate change is not about birding, of course. It's about the gradual disruption of ecosystems and all the flora and fauna that depend on those systems being in balance.
The global climate talks in Paris last month yielded a glimmer of optimism. We'll see.

We found a highly unlikely bird last month during the Christmas Bird Count at Cantigny — a Nashville warbler. The species migrates through our region in the spring and early fall, and during those times it's pretty easy to spot one. But after October? Good luck with that.
So what was a Nashville warbler doing here on Dec. 19? And what about the painted bunting that caused a media sensation in New York City, also in December?
The knee-jerk response to these questions might be two words: climate change. Or an even better guess: El Nino. But cases of misplaced birds are nothing new. Storms and strong winds are often to blame, or sometimes a bird's internal compass just goes haywire. Birds get lost.
That said, warmer conditions may cause a wayward bird to stay put in the same place for days or weeks, assuming it locates a food source. It learns to adjust.
Indeed, the ability of birds to adapt to new environmental conditions is one of their key strengths. That's the good news. The bad news is that global warming in the decades ahead will test their resourcefulness like never before.
In November I went to hear a talk about the effects of climate change on birds in the Chicago region. The speaker was Doug Stotz, a conservation ecologist and ornithologist at the Field Museum in Chicago. He's also the co-chairman of the Chicago Wilderness Climate Change Task Force.
"The great thing about climate change is that it makes our winters warmer," Stotz said. "It's hard, as a Chicagoan, not to think that's a good idea."
Yes, I think we could all agree that ditching the down-filled parkas and flannel-lined jeans would be OK. And what birder around here would not enjoy some traditionally southern or southwest species moving into our region as average temperatures climb?
We know it's wrong, but it's hard to stop visions of painted buntings and scissor-tailed flycatchers from dancing in our heads. A few southern beauties are already here.
"Blue grosbeak, summer tanager and yellow-throated warbler are birds that didn't use to breed in the Chicago area, but they do now," Stotz said.
But whatever advantages climate change may hold for shivering Chicagoans and thrill-seeking birders, Stotz made one thing perfectly clear: Global warming is not good for most birds. The science tells us so.
In 2014, the National Audubon Society unveiled a seven-year study on the predicted impact of climate change on North American bird populations.
Out of 588 species studied, 314 were deemed at risk from global warming by 2080. For many, according to Audubon's climate model, the "gathering storm" will come sooner. To survive, the birds must adapt to losing huge portions of their current living areas.
Stotz cited the bobolink, a grassland species that even now struggles to prosper in the Chicago region. Climate change is shifting the bird's range northward. By 2050, he said, "Bobolinks are going to be in what is now boreal forest. It seems unlikely that will work."
Of the 314 at-risk species identified by Audubon, 126 are classified as "climate endangered," meaning they are projected to lose more than 50 percent of their current range by 2050 if global warming continues at its current pace.
Even common birds not listed in the Audubon study could vanish from our region due to climatic stress. The black-capped chickadee, Stotz said, could vacate Illinois, moving north as temperatures rise.
Avian visitors we look forward to seeing only in winter may no longer "drop down." If you are lucky enough to see a redpoll, a crossbill or northern shrike this winter, savor the experience. Spotting these and other species in the Chicago region may become significantly more challenging.
Sorry, that's the birder in me coming out again. Climate change is not about birding, of course. It's about the gradual disruption of ecosystems and all the flora and fauna that depend on those systems being in balance.
The global climate talks in Paris last month yielded a glimmer of optimism. We'll see.
"It's easy to feel overwhelmed," Audubon's President and CEO David Yarnold wrote more than a year ago, and I'll bet he feels the same way today. Don't we all?
For those who study birds, there is hope. Through effective habitat management, Stotz thinks the bobolink and other vulnerable species can be saved.
"One of the big things we can do to fight climate change is to get our natural areas into the best condition possible," he said. "There is no question that birds in a healthy environment can hold on in the face of climate change much better than if they are already stressed."

A local effort to tackle climate change Climate: Power plant operator says changes have been made

Addressing climate change is at a critical point, according to Lake County leaders and environmentalists who rallied on the Lake Michigan shore Saturday to launch an initiative aimed at combating the issue locally. Extensive flooding in Lake County last month is one example of the destructive consequences of a "climate on steroids" that can't be ignored, said Julio Cesar Guzman, an organizer with the Sierra Club, a national grass-roots environmental group. "We saw the impact of climate change. It was a burdensome reality," he said in advance of Saturday's event in Waukegan. 
Local action is critical because the federal government has "abdicated its role in climate leadership," according to the Sierra Club. Lake County Board Chairman Aaron Lawlor joined supporters in introducing the Lake County Climate Action Pledge, which urges community leaders and officials to take bipartisan action on the what was described as a climate crisis. "If we get a coalition of county, state and federal leaders, we can bite off a piece of that challenge," Lawlor said. The initiative was introduced in front of the NRG Energy Inc., coal-fired power plant, as part of Clean Power Lake County's fourth annual beach rally and cleanup. The pledge has three "pillars": Move Lake County beyond coal, adopt ambitious clean energy goals, and build climate-resilient infrastructure. Those goals do not suggest specific measures but are designed to encourage local officials to minimize environmental impacts when considering projects. "How are we building in a smart way that will mitigate the next big rain event?" Guzman explained. Any initiative will include closing the NRG plant, he said. The facility, which produces enough electricity to serve the needs of about 668,000 households, has been a target in recent years for Clean Power Lake County because of air and water emissions. "No one can say we want to tackle climate change knowing it's catalyzed by carbon emissions," Guzman said. "It needs to be addressed." NRG spokesman David Gaier said the company has invested $107 million in additional emission controls at the Waukegan plant and the company meets all laws and regulations. "We promised to modernize the plant and make it cleaner and greener, and that's what we've done," he said. The Waukegan plant produces electricity for a grid covering 13 states and Washington, D.C. Investments there and elsewhere in Illinois have "single-handedly" achieved 64 percent of statewide carbon emission reductions called for in the federal Clean Power Plan, Gaier said. Dismantling that plan by the new administration has been decried by environmentalists. Lawlor said local officials can take actions that have a larger impact, such as revitalizing the lakefront in Waukegan. That would be a boost to the city and the region, but it won't happen with an operating power plant, Lawlor said. "We might as well have an orderly process of what the facility becomes," he said. "The sooner the better on the power plant and the sooner the better on its closure." Gaier said coal-powered plants will be phased out eventually, and he noted the company retired one of the two coal units at its Romeoville plant and converted the Joliet plant to natural gas. However, there is a short-term need for "controlled" coal plants in the power generating system, he said. The company in April met with leaders of the Sierra Club and Clean Power Lake County and said the plant is economically viable and continues to supply affordable and reliable power to Illinois consumers, he said. Meanwhile, Lawlor and others urged fellow officials to take action to reduce the county's carbon footprint. "This pledge offers a window of opportunity for civic engagement," Guzman said.

Lake County restoration project to see if native grasses are key to dealing with climate change

Restoring landscapes to their native state is a regular practice for the Lake County Forest Preserve District, but a pending project at Grant Woods in Ingleside has the added aspect of climate change as a key element. In late October or early November, more than 800 pounds of native grass seed will be sown over 180 acres of what had been rolling agricultural fields east of Route 59 and north of Monaville Road. Two thirds of the land will be sown with seed "sourced" farther south than normally would be the case to determine whether it will be a better choice for future restorations as climate change progresses. "We know that by 2050, our climate is predicted to be more like Oklahoma," said Pati Vitt, manager of restoration ecology for the forest preserve district and originator of the "Growing Through Change" project. 
"This is more what I consider a demonstration project to see how we are sourcing seeds," Vitt added. "Should we be sourcing farther south and if so, how much farther south?" Along with the grasses, sedges will be planted in wetland areas on the site. Flowering plants will follow in fall 2021. The area is one part of an ongoing restoration at Grant Woods, which covers 1,226 acres. The broader effort has been facilitated by donations of more than $1.1 million to the Preservation Foundation of the Lake County Forest Preserves by a couple with long, personal ties to the land but who wish to remain anonymous, according to Rebekah Snyder, executive director. Some of that money, along with a $216,000 grant from the national Wildlife Conservation Society Climate Adaptation Fund, will be used for the $350,000 farmland restoration. "It's not just putting native seed on this agricultural parcel," Snyder said. "What we wanted to do was take a climate change model and put it on top of that." Vitt, who came to the forest district nearly two years ago, had been curator of the seed bank collection at the Chicago Botanic Garden. She's been considering the effects of climate change on native plant populations and seeds being used for 15 years or more. The restoration community long has grappled with this complex issue, and the Grant Woods project presents an opportunity to compare a new strategy with standard practice to determine what might work best going forward, according to Vitt. "This is a highly different approach," she said. "The concern might be if we don't keep up with that quickly changing climate, we could find in 20 years the plants in our natural areas aren't producing well enough." Because many species of pollinators respond to temperature, while plants respond to the length of the daylight, the two could get out of sync as the average temperature increases, according to Vitt. The district will monitor how the southern grasses survive, grow and reproduce, and whether their use will be more successful than standard strategies. "We can grow most anything but will it handle the new climate that's coming?" said Ken Klick, the forest district's site ecologist for Grant Woods. "Plants from farther south may be favored in this changing climate in the future," he added. "Kentucky, Missouri, Arkansas — those would be the areas we're pinpointing," for grass seed. While climate models appear to be accurate in projecting what the changes will be, timing is less certain, Vitt said. That means the project runs the risk of sourcing too far south for current conditions. "We simply don't know," she said. "There have been few, if any, demonstration projects at this scale to explore this." Vitt says the research is needed to protect plant vitality and protect native ecosystems, and also provide fresh "marketplace opportunities" for retailers and consumers. It also could become a key seed source for other entities in the future, Klick noted. "This may be one of the most valuable restorations in the region 50 years from now," he said.

BARCELONA, Spain — Climate change could push more than 200 million people to leave their homes in the next three decades and create migration hot spots unless urgent action is taken to reduce global emissions and bridge the development gap, a World Bank report has found. The second part of the Groundswell report published Monday examined how the impacts of slow-onset climate change such as water scarcity, decreasing crop productivity and rising sea levels could lead to millions of what it describes as "climate migrants" by 2050 under three different scenarios with varying degrees of climate action and development. Under the most pessimistic scenario, with a high level of emissions and unequal development, the report forecasts up to 216 million people moving within their own countries across the six regions analyzed. 
Those regions are Latin America, North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe and Central Asia, South Asia, and East Asia and the Pacific. In the most climate-friendly scenario, with a low level of emissions and inclusive, sustainable development, the world could still see 44 million people being forced to leave their homes. The findings "reaffirm the potency of climate to induce migration within countries," said Viviane Wei Chen Clement, a senior climate change specialist at the World Bank and one of the report's authors. The report didn't look at the short-term impacts of climate change, such as the effects of extreme weather events, and did not look at climate migration across borders. In the worst-case scenario, sub-Saharan Africa — the most vulnerable region due to desertification, fragile coastlines and the population's dependence on agriculture — would see the most migrants, with up to 86 million people moving within national borders. North Africa, however, is predicted to have the largest proportion of climate migrants, with 19 million people moving, equivalent to roughly 9% of its population, due mainly to increased water scarcity in northeastern Tunisia, northwestern Algeria, western and southern Morocco, and the central Atlas foothills, the report said. In South Asia, Bangladesh is particularly affected by flooding and crop failures, accounting for almost half of the predicted climate migrants, with 19.9 million people, including an increasing number of women, moving by 2050 under the pessimistic scenario. "This is our humanitarian reality right now and we are concerned this is going to be even worse, where vulnerability is more acute," said Maarten van Aalst, director of the International Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, who wasn't involved with the report. Many scientists say the world is no longer on track to the worst-case scenario for emissions. But even under a more moderate scenario, van Aalst said many impacts are now occurring faster than previously expected, "including the extremes we are already experiencing, as well as potential implications for migration and displacement."

Pentagon revises report, removes ‘climate change' and some effects

WASHINGTON — Internal changes to a draft Defense Department report de-emphasized the threats climate change poses to military bases and installations, muting or removing references to climate-driven changes in the Arctic and potential risks from rising seas, an unpublished draft obtained by The Washington Post reveals. The earlier version of the document, dated December 2016, contains numerous references to "climate change" that were omitted or altered to "extreme weather" or simply "climate" in the final report, which was submitted to Congress in January 2018. While the phrase "climate change" appears 23 separate times in the draft report, the final version used it just once. Those and other edits suggest the Pentagon has adapted its approach to public discussion of climate change under President Donald Trump, who has expressed doubt about the reality of a phenomenon that scientists agree presents an increasing danger to the planet. 
While military leaders have said they see a changing climate as a driver of instability worldwide, they have also sought to stay out of a politically charged debate about its causes. Heather Babb, a Pentagon spokeswoman, declined to comment on the draft report, which outlines the results of the department's first-ever survey of officials at different installations about the effects of climate change. The Post was not able to verify who made the changes reflected in the two documents. "As highlighted in the report, the effects of climate are a national security issue with potential impacts to missions, operational plans, and installations," Babb said in a statement. "DOD continues to focus on ensuring its installations and infrastructure are resilient to a wide range of threats, including climate. The Department has a proven record of planning and preparing for such threats." According to John Conger, who served as a senior Pentagon official under the Obama administration and was among the officials who initiated the multi-base survey that forms the basis of the report, employees from a dozen different Defense Department offices could have made changes to the text as it made its way through the bureaucracy's clearance process, which often makes for "lowest common denominator" documents. Conger said the alterations "change the feeling of urgency in the report, but not its fundamental conclusion — that our military installations are clearly experiencing climate impacts." The final document, a 32-page report to Congress, was published more than a year after the earlier draft. It, like its earlier version, finds that out of more than 3,500 military sites around the world, 782 reported being affected by drought, 763 by major wind events, and 706 by flooding, along with other problems — results that drew considerable attention when they debuted in late January. But the December 2016 draft was far more direct in its discussion of climate change and in particular the issue of sea-level rise — a well-known problem facing many military sites in coastal areas.

14th District candidates back green energy but far apart on climate change

14th District candidates back green energy but far apart on climate change Both candidates for the 14th Congressional District support the pursuit of green energy, but climate change is a different story. Incumbent Republican Randy Hultgren has a polar opposite perspective from his Democratic challenger, Lauren Underwood, when it comes to what's fueling climate change and steps taken to address it so far. Hultgren joined the bipartisan, 74-member Climate Solutions Caucus in April. The mission of the caucus is to explore economically-viable options to "reduce climate risk" and work on legislation that can "address the impacts, causes and challenges of our changing climate" and also receive bipartisan support when it comes time for a vote. 
In announcing his admission into the caucus, Hultgren pointed to his interest in modernizing Argonne National Laboratory and Fermilab, and giving Illinois' communities choices in where their energy comes from as his motivation. St. Charles' work with the Illinois Municipal Electric Agency to bring solar power to the area is a prime example of creating such choice. In written interviews subsequent to the caucus announcement, Hultgren indicated he is not on board with all the stances his new caucus members take when it comes to climate change. For one, the caucus pushed President Donald Trump to maintain the United States' commitment to the Paris climate accord. Hultgren does not support that agreement. "I don't support climate change policies that place American workers behind the rest of the world," Hultgren said. "The Paris agreement hurt American workers and allowed Chinese factories to keep polluting at extremely high levels." Part of Hultgren's objection to the Paris agreement stems from what he views as a "flawed premise" in the Clean Power Plan that Trump administration officials are trying to repeal. The plan is considered former President Barack Obama's signature climate change policy. It created new rules to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. power plants. Hultgren said the plan was not "grounded in law and the Constitution" and he believes it will not withstand a legal challenge. Hultgren said encouraging new, cleaner energy production is a better method to reduce carbon pollution than punishing users of less clean forms. "The carrot is better than the stick, and federal R & D (research and development) will help emerging technologies to get to the point of adoption," he said. Underwood takes the opposite view. In a written interview, she said pulling out of the Paris agreement was "a mistake." "We ceded our international leadership role, and we are not unable to achieve an important multilateral goal of reducing emissions," she said. She believes the Clean Power Plan was "a strong step" to curb carbon pollution and reduce methane from the oil and gas industry. "The Trump Administration's attempt to dismantle the Clean Power Plan is hazardous to our planet and is an economic and environmental threat to our country," Underwood said. Neither candidate directly answered a question about whether they support any form of a tax on carbon polluters. Likewise, when asked how much humans have contributed to climate change, Hultgren said there "are a number of contributing factors." "Humans have certainly polluted the earth, and it is our responsibility to develop cleaner technologies," he said. "I teach my kids we are stewards of the earth, and we have a responsibility toward it." Underwood said she believes the science to date includes clear evidence "that human activity is a significant catalyst toward climate change, producing increased carbon emissions that have caused lasting damage to our planet."

Both candidates for the 14th Congressional District seat support the pursuit of green energy, but climate change is a different story. Incumbent Republican Randy Hultgren has a polar opposite perspective from his Democratic challenger, Lauren Underwood, when it comes to what's fueling climate change and steps taken to address it so far. Hultgren joined the bipartisan, 74-member Climate Solutions Caucus in April. The mission of the caucus is to explore economically viable options to "reduce climate risk" and work on legislation that can "address the impacts, causes and challenges of our changing climate" and also receive bipartisan support when it comes time for a vote. 
In announcing his admission into the caucus, Hultgren pointed to his interest in modernizing Argonne National Laboratory and Fermilab and in giving Illinois' communities choices in where their energy comes from as his motivation. St. Charles' work with the Illinois Municipal Electric Agency to bring solar power to the area is a prime example of creating such choice. In written interviews subsequent to the caucus announcement, Hultgren indicated he is not on board with all the stances his new caucus members take on climate change. For one, the caucus pushed President Donald Trump to maintain the United States' commitment to the Paris climate accord. Hultgren does not support that agreement. "I don't support climate change policies that place American workers behind the rest of the world," said Hultgren, who lives in Plano. "The Paris agreement hurt American workers and allowed Chinese factories to keep polluting at extremely high levels." Part of Hultgren's objection to the Paris agreement stems from what he views as a "flawed premise" in the Clean Power Plan that Trump administration officials are trying to repeal. The plan is considered former President Barack Obama's signature climate change policy. It created new rules to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. power plants. Hultgren said the plan was not "grounded in law and the Constitution, and he believes it will not withstand a legal challenge. Hultgren said encouraging new, cleaner energy production is a better method to reduce carbon pollution than punishing users of less clean forms. "The carrot is better than the stick, and federal R&D (research and development) will help emerging technologies to get to the point of adoption," he said. Underwood, a Naperville resident, takes the opposite view. In a written interview, she said pulling out of the Paris agreement was "a mistake." "We ceded our international leadership role, and we are not unable to achieve an important multilateral goal of reducing emissions," she said. She believes the Clean Power Plan was "a strong step" to curb carbon pollution and reduce methane from the oil and gas industry. "The Trump Administration's attempt to dismantle the Clean Power Plan is hazardous to our planet and is an economic and environmental threat to our country," Underwood said. Neither candidate directly answered a question about supporting any form of a tax on carbon polluters. Likewise, when asked how much humans have contributed to climate change, Hultgren said there "are a number of contributing factors." "Humans have certainly polluted the earth, and it is our responsibility to develop cleaner technologies," he said. "I teach my kids we are stewards of the earth, and we have a responsibility toward it." Underwood said she believes the science to date includes clear evidence "that human activity is a significant catalyst toward climate change, producing increased carbon emissions that have caused lasting damage to our planet." The sprawling 14th Congressional District includes parts of DuPage, Kane, Lake and McHenry counties. The general election is Nov. 6.

Illinois needs to take the reins toward a clean energy future now and charge forward in the fight against climate change. While Bidenâ€™s administration has swiftly mobilized a national team to combat climate change, climate action in Illinois has been put on hold, seemingly indefinitely. But climate change wonâ€™t wait around for us to get our act together, and inaction has consequences. While the state legislature keeps its residents on standby, Illinoisans statewide have come together to demand action. 
For a few years now, the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition (a statewide grassroots coalition of organizations composed of energy experts, Illinois consumers, climate and environmental justice advocates, and more) has worked tirelessly on drafting the Clean Energy Jobs Act (CEJA). To do this, the coalition proactively sought out input from dozens of communities and asked them about their needs, concerns and hopes. CEJA is now a 900-page comprehensive climate action bill that is geared toward enabling a just transition to renewable energy across Illinois. Its predecessor - the Future Energy Jobs Act (FEJA) - was passed with bipartisan support in December 2016 by requiring greater energy efficiency, creating workforce development programs and increasing access to renewable energy. It required ComEd to develop and enhance customer efficiency programs to cut electricity waste by approximately 22% and Ameren by 16% by 2030 - providing critical incentives for companies to meet and exceed their targets. But FEJA on its own is not enough. CEJA is the only legislation currently before Springfield that could yield consumer savings, hold notorious Illinois utility companies accountable to consumers, require fossil fuel energy providers to pay for the pollution theyâ€™ve created (aka not leaving taxpayers to foot the bill), while increasing energy efficiency standards to more effective levels and maximizing benefits from lowered cost of wind and solar. CEJA aligns regulation with state and customer priorities, ensuring that electric utilities actually serve the public interest and operate transparently. For example, CEJA promises to protect Illinois from a federal regulatory ruling that could slap an additional $1.7B onto Illinois consumersâ€™ energy bills over the next ten years (money which, per the federal ruling, would go to bail out the fossil fuel industry). The merits of CEJA donâ€™t stop there. CEJA contains provisions to transition displaced fossil fuel workers into clean energy jobs, and it designates communities that lose a fossil fuel plant or coal mine as â€œClean Energy Empowerment Zones,â€ providing local governments in these zones a tax base replacement to recover from any lost revenues due to closures. CEJA emphasizes the need for an equitable and diverse workforce, dedicating nearly $100M annually toward workforce development and Illinois Solar for All. CEJA is a critical climate action bill for the state because it targets carbon emissions - a central factor contributing to climate change - by incentivizing zero-to-low carbon renewable energy sources to replace fossil fuels, and it does so by addressing numerous cross-cutting issues faced by Illinoisans statewide, including Lake County residents. For example, Lake County has an â€œFâ€ from the American Lung Association. By shifting away from dirty energy sources, like coal-powered plants still operating in our region, Lake County residents have a chance to breathe cleaner air and, thus, be relieved of the prime contributing factors to increased respiratory issues (such as asthma) in the area. Climate action is non-negotiable. Whether we want to or not, everyone will be tasked with making climate-imposed decisions that affect their families, friends, communities, states, and neighbors over the coming years. However, if we act in time and we act in a manner that comprehensively addresses the intersectional issues that climate action comprises, we can come out ahead. By passing CEJA, Illinois can lead the renewable energy transition in a way that leaves no one behind. While originally introduced in the state legislature in early 2019 (but postponed due to COVID-19), CEJA was reintroduced this past week. Itâ€™s time to hold our elected officials accountable to take critical steps forward and ensure that CEJA will be passed this year. You can learn more about CEJA at the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition website (www.ilcleanjobs.org) and contact your state representatives to demand they sponsor the bill today. Even if they are a sponsor, you can thank them for signing on and ask them to make passing CEJA a priority.

Lake County leaders pledge to tackle climate change

Lake County leaders pledge to tackle climate change Addressing climate change is at a critical point, according to Lake County leaders and environmentalists who rallied on the Lake Michigan shore Saturday to launch an initiative aimed at combating the issue locally. Extensive flooding in Lake County last month is one example of the destructive consequences of a "climate on steroids" that can't be ignored, said Julio Cesar Guzman, an organizer with the Sierra Club, a national grass-roots environmental group. "We saw the impact of climate change. It was a burdensome reality," he said in advance of Saturday's event in Waukegan. 
Local action is critical because the federal government has "abdicated its role in climate leadership," according to the Sierra Club. Lake County Board Chairman Aaron Lawlor joined supporters in introducing the Lake County Climate Action Pledge, which urges community leaders and officials to take bipartisan action on the what was described as a climate crisis. "If we get a coalition of county, state and federal leaders, we can bite off a piece of that challenge," Lawlor said. The initiative was introduced in front of the NRG Energy Inc., coal-fired power plant, as part of Clean Power Lake County's fourth annual beach rally and cleanup. The pledge has three "pillars": Move Lake County beyond coal, adopt ambitious clean energy goals, and build climate-resilient infrastructure. Those goals do not suggest specific measures but are designed to encourage local officials to minimize environmental impacts when considering projects. "How are we building in a smart way that will mitigate the next big rain event?" Guzman explained. Any initiative will include closing the NRG plant, he said. The facility, which produces enough electricity to serve the needs of about 668,000 households, has been a target in recent years for Clean Power Lake County because of air and water emissions. "No one can say we want to tackle climate change knowing it's catalyzed by carbon emissions," Guzman said. "It needs to be addressed." NRG spokesman David Gaier said the company has invested $107 million in additional emission controls at the Waukegan plant and the company meets all laws and regulations. "We promised to modernize the plant and make it cleaner and greener, and that's what we've done," he said. The Waukegan plant produces electricity for a grid covering 13 states and Washington, D.C. Investments there and elsewhere in Illinois have "single-handedly" achieved 64 percent of statewide carbon emission reductions called for in the federal Clean Power Plan, Gaier said. Dismantling that plan by the new administration has been decried by environmentalists. Lawlor said local officials can take actions that have a larger impact, such as revitalizing the lakefront in Waukegan. That would be a boost to the city and the region, but it won't happen with an operating power plant, Lawlor said. "We might as well have an orderly process of what the facility becomes," he said. "The sooner the better on the power plant and the sooner the better on its closure." Gaier said coal-powered plants will be phased out eventually, and he noted the company retired one of the two coal units at its Romeoville plant and converted the Joliet plant to natural gas. However, there is a short-term need for "controlled" coal plants in the power generating system, he said. The company in April met with leaders of the Sierra Club and Clean Power Lake County and said the plant is economically viable and continues to supply affordable and reliable power to Illinois consumers, he said. Meanwhile, Lawlor and others urged fellow officials to take action to reduce the county's carbon footprint. "This pledge offers a window of opportunity for civic engagement," Guzman said.

Project to see if native grasses can be a key to dealing with climate change

Restoring landscapes to their native state is a regular practice for the Lake County Forest Preserve District, but a pending project at Grant Woods in Ingleside has the added aspect of climate change as a key element. In late October or early November, more than 800 pounds of native grass seed will be sown over 180 acres of what had been rolling agricultural fields east of Route 59 and north of Monaville Road. Two thirds of the land will be sown with seed "sourced" farther south than normally would be the case to determine whether it will be a better choice for future restorations as climate change progresses. "We know that by 2050, our climate is predicted to be more like Oklahoma," said Pati Vitt, manager of restoration ecology for the forest preserve district and originator of the "Growing Through Change" project. 
"This is more what I consider a demonstration project to see how we are sourcing seeds," Vitt added. "Should we be sourcing farther south and if so, how much farther south?" Along with the grasses, sedges will be planted in wetland areas on the site. Flowering plants will follow in fall 2021. The area is one part of an ongoing restoration at Grant Woods, which covers 1,226 acres. The broader effort has been facilitated by donations of more than $1.1 million to the Preservation Foundation of the Lake County Forest Preserves by a couple with long, personal ties to the land but who wish to remain anonymous, according to Rebekah Snyder, executive director. Some of that money, along with a $216,000 grant from the national Wildlife Conservation Society Climate Adaptation Fund, will be used for the $350,000 farmland restoration. "It's not just putting native seed on this agricultural parcel," Snyder said. "What we wanted to do was take a climate change model and put it on top of that." Vitt, who came to the forest district nearly two years ago, had been curator of the seed bank collection at the Chicago Botanic Garden. She's been considering the effects of climate change on native plant populations and seeds being used for 15 years or more. The restoration community long has grappled with this complex issue, and the Grant Woods project presents an opportunity to compare a new strategy with standard practice to determine what might work best going forward, according to Vitt. "This is a highly different approach," she said. "The concern might be if we don't keep up with that quickly changing climate, we could find in 20 years the plants in our natural areas aren't producing well enough." Because many species of pollinators respond to temperature, while plants respond to the length of the daylight, the two could get out of sync as the average temperature increases, according to Vitt. The district will monitor how the southern grasses survive, grow and reproduce, and whether their use will be more successful than standard strategies. "We can grow most anything but will it handle the new climate that's coming?" said Ken Klick, the forest district's site ecologist for Grant Woods. While climate models appear to be accurate in projecting what the changes will be, timing is less certain, Vitt said. That means the project runs the risk of sourcing too far south for current conditions. "We simply don't know," she said. "There have been few, if any, demonstration projects at this scale to explore this." Vitt says the research is needed to protect plant vitality and protect native ecosystems, and also provide fresh "marketplace opportunities" for retailers and consumers. It also could become a key seed source for other entities in the future, Klick noted. "This may be one of the most valuable restorations in the region 50 years from now," he said.

Money men tally cost of climate change

NEW YORK — Climate change is likely to exact enormous costs on U.S. regional economies in the form of lost property, reduced industrial output and more deaths, according to a report backed by a trio of men with vast business experience.
The report is designed to convince businesses to factor in the cost of climate change in their long-term decisions and to push for reductions in emissions blamed for heating the planet.
It was commissioned by the Risky Business Project, which describes itself as nonpartisan and is chaired by former New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, former Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Thomas F. Steyer, a former hedge fund manager.
"If we act immediately, we can still avoid most of the worst impacts of climate change and significantly reduce the odds of catastrophic outcomes," Paulson said.
Among the predictions: Between $66 billion and $106 billion in coastal property will likely be below sea level by 2050, labor productivity of outdoor workers could be reduced by 3 percent because extremely hot days will be far more frequent, and demand for electricity to power air conditioners will require the construction of more power plants that will cost electricity customers up to $12 billion per year.
"Every year that goes by without a comprehensive public and private sector response to climate change is a year that locks in future climate events that will have a far more devastating effect on our local, regional, and national economies," warn the report's authors.
The analysis and calculations in the report were performed by the Rhodium Group, an economic research firm, and Risk Management Solutions, a catastrophe-modeling company that works for insurance companies and other businesses. It was paid for by the philanthropic foundations of Bloomberg, Paulson and Steyer, among others.
The report analyzes the impacts of climate change by region to better show how climate change affects the businesses and industries that drive each region's economy.
* The Northeast will likely be most affected by sea level rise, which will cost an additional $6 billion to $9 billion in property loss each year.
* The Southeast will likely be affected both by sea-level rise and extreme temperatures. The region, which has averaged eight days of temperatures over 95 degrees each year, will likely see an additional 17 to 52 of these days by midcentury and up to four months of them by the end of the century. This could lead to 11,000 to 36,000 additional deaths per year.
* Higher temperatures will reduce Midwest crop yields by 19 percent by midcentury and by 63 percent by the end of the century.
* The Southwest will see an extra month of temperatures above 95 degrees by 2050, which will lead to more frequent droughts and wildfires.
The report does not calculate the cost of these droughts or wildfires, or many other possible costs such as the loss of unique ecosystems and species and the possible compounding effects of extreme weather conditions. Nor does it calculate some of the ways economies could adapt to the changing climate and reduce the costs of climate change.
"There's a whole litany of things not calculated in the assessment," said Gary Yohe, an economics and environmental studies at Wesleyan University and vice chair of the National Climate Assessment, a U.S. government project set up to study the effects of climate change. Yohe was not part of the Risky Business Project report, but he was asked to review it.
Still, he said, "The general conclusions are right on the money."
He also said that while other groups have also attempted to calculate the financial impacts of climate change around the world, this report is notable because of the business and financial experience of the people behind it. Beyond the three co-chairs, the members of the group's risk committee include Former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, former Cargill CEO Gregory Page, and George Shultz, former treasury secretary and secretary of state.
"These are people who have managed risk all their lives and have made an enormous amount of money doing so," Yohe said.

Longer heat waves. Rising sea levels. Stronger hurricanes. More intense droughts. An ice-free summer in the Arctic Ocean by 2050.
That's what future generations can expect as the effects of global warming, accelerated by heat-trapping gases like methane and carbon dioxide, continue to alter weather patterns around the world.
James Hansen, a leading climate change researcher, and Tom Skilling, WGN-TV's chief meteorologist, will take an in-depth look at this phenomenon and discuss potential efforts to reduce its impact when they visit Benedictine University at 7 p.m. Thursday, April 21, in the Goodwin Hall Auditorium on campus, 5700 College Road, Lisle.
Hansen will present "Energy and Climate Change: How Can Justice be Achieved for Young People?" Skilling will serve as the event's moderator and emcee. The event is free, but seating is limited.
Hansen is an adjunct professor at Columbia University's Earth Institute, where he directs the Climate Science, Awareness and Solutions program, and is a former director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies.
He is widely known for his work and testimony to Congress on climate change in the 1980s that helped raise awareness of global warming.
A member of the National Academy of Sciences, Hansen has received numerous awards, including the Sophie
and Blue Planet prizes, and is recognized for outlining actions needed to protect the future of young people and all species on the planet.
Skilling is a nationally recognized meteorologist who has been called "a weatherman's weather forecaster," and has more than 30 years of experience at WGN-TV in Chicago.
He is known for his in-depth reports, enthusiasm and use of state-of-the-art technology, and has written about the need for meteorologists to acknowledge and educate the public about the threat of climate change.
In addition to his television, radio and print work, Skilling has created many weather specials and documentaries. He received the Award for Outstanding Service by a Broadcast Meteorologist from the American Meteorological Society in 1997.
Skilling and Hansen were invited to speak at Benedictine by the university's nonpartisan, nonprofit Center for Civic Leadership, which seeks to bring dynamic speakers to campus so that students and the larger community can immerse themselves in multiple issues and topics of public concern.

Climate change is here And the impact is going to grow increasingly more devastating if we fail to respond now

If you're like us, when the tornado warnings were going out across the suburbs last week, along with several days of stormy weather, you may have wondered: Is this one more symptom of climate change? That's impossible to answer with any precision. We have had tornadoes and stormy weeks before. 
It's hard to pinpoint the cause of any single weather event. But what is clear is that extreme weather — like the record heat waves, horrific wildfires and unprecedented flooding that have ravaged spots all around the globe this summer — is a hallmark of this undeniable change. What is becoming painfully clear is that climate change is not some distant threat. Climate change is here. Now. And the impact of it is only going to get worse. It's going to get worse even if we do something about it. All we're left with now is to minimize how much worse it gets. If we do nothing or next to nothing, if we continue to kid ourselves that it's just part of the natural ebb and flow of the planet's weather, well, then it will become a catastrophe. If we all have not been alarmed by the myriad examples of extreme weather so far in 2021, we should be by the report released last week by the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Its report on the state of the worldwide environment warns that world leaders must act immediately to reduce human reliance on fossil fuels or risk significant growth of extreme weather events. But this is not just a matter for world leaders and politicians. It is an existential challenge that calls on all of us to do our parts. Some responses will be easy. Some will be hard. All must be done. We must reduce the flow of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and we must make wise choices in how we adapt to the climate change that already has been set in motion. The U.N. panel said scientists are observing irrefutable climate changes in every region of the planet. "Many of the changes observed in the climate are unprecedented in thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of years, and some of the changes already set in motion — such as continued sea level rise — are irreversible over hundreds to thousands of years," the panel said. Left unchecked, these changes will affect virtually everything about human life as well as the lives of other animals who share the planet with us: Our water and food supplies, sea levels, where and how we live, our health, our economies, virtually everything. "We just barely have the time," U.S. Rep. Sean Casten of Downers Grove said. "Our moment is right now to do what's necessary." We can pretend no longer.

World Bank: Climate change could result in 100 million poor
Chicago Daily Herald

STOCKHOLM — Climate change could push more than 100 million people into extreme poverty by 2030 by disrupting agriculture and fueling the spread of malaria and other diseases, the World Bank said in a report Sunday.
Released just weeks ahead of a U.N. climate summit in Paris, the report highlighted how the impact of global warming is borne unevenly, with the world's poor woefully unprepared to deal with climate shocks such as rising seas or severe droughts.
"They have fewer resources and receive less support from family, community, the financial system, and even social safety nets to prevent, cope and adapt," the Washington-based World Bank said.
How to help poor countries — and poor communities within countries — deal with climate change is one of the crunch issues in talks on a global climate accord that's supposed to be adopted next month in Paris.
Those who say that rich countries aren't doing enough to help the poor said the report added emphasis to demands for billions of dollars in so-called climate finance to developing countries.
"The statistics in the World Bank report are suitably shocking and I hope they force world leaders to sit up and take notice," said Mohamed Adow of Christian Aid. "The Paris deal needs to support the poor and vulnerable communities to cope with unavoidable climate crises better, and to be more resilient to a changed climate."
Despite pledges to rein in emissions of carbon dioxide and other global warming gases, climate change isn't likely to stop anytime soon. Carbon emissions are expected to rise for many years as China, India and other developing countries expand the use of fossil fuels to power their economies.
But efforts to protect the poor, such as generally improving access to health care and social safety nets, and targeted measures to upgrade flood defenses and deploy more heat-tolerant crops could prevent most of the negative consequences of climate change on poverty, the bank said.
"Absent such good development, climate change could result in an additional 100 million people living in extreme poverty by 2030," the report said.
Stephane Hallegatte, one of the authors, said one of the unique features of the report was that instead of analyzing the macroeconomic impact of climate change it was based in part on surveys of 1.4 million people in 92 countries.
"When we ask people why they fall into poverty there are three major factors," he said. "Agricultural shocks, including an increase in food prices; natural disasters such as floods, droughts, storms; and health issues, including malaria, diarrhea."
The report referred to studies showing climate change could result in global crop yield losses as large as 5 percent by 2030 and 30 percent by 2080. It also referenced studies showing warming temperatures could increase the number of people at risk for malaria by 150 million.
Hallegatte said the "hot spots" for climate impacts on poor people were sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.
The U.S. and other countries have collectively pledged to scale up climate financing to developed countries to $100 billion annually by 2020 to help them adapt to climate change and reduce their emissions.
Developing countries are calling for commitments beyond 2020 in the Paris agreement but rich nations are reluctant to make firm promises, in part due to budget uncertainties.
A recent report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development estimated climate finance flows to developing countries reached $62 billion in 2014.w

Republicans playing the long game on term limits Recount: Kirk's statement about climate change raises eyebrows Recount: Kirk's statement about climate change raises eyebrows

A key effort of the Rauner campaign has re-emerged in the Legislature, but the suburban lawmaker behind it says he's playing the long game.
State Rep. Ron Sandack, a Downers Grove Republican, has proposed an amendment to the Illinois Constitution calling for 10-year term limits for state lawmakers.
Rauner tried to get a similar measure put before voters on the November ballot, but it was tossed in court. Still, it remained a major talking point for a campaign running against the Springfield establishment.
Sandack says he knows that establishment — Democrats who control the House and Senate — won't let his plan go anywhere.
Plus, opponents of term limits say cutting off experienced lawmakers puts government in the hands of people who aren't term-limited and can profit from their knowledge — like lobbyists.
Sandack says he didn't introduce it in conjunction with Rauner but hopes keeping the issue alive could help drive public support for another push in 2016.
"The folks in charge of the
General Assembly are still in charge," Sandack said.
Mappin'
For a term-limits plan to succeed in Illinois, backers might need more help with legal support than voter support because the courts tripped it up.
Sandack is also behind a similarly fated plan to change the way state political boundaries are drawn. Democrats redrew the legislative and congressional maps on their own in 2010 and stand to reap the benefits until the next census.
The idea to change the process also got booted off the ballots by courts last year, and moving it through the Legislature would be asking the people who drew the maps to change the game. Again, quite unlikely.
Elimination game
Republican state Rep. David McSweeney of Barrington Hills won House approval of his amendment eliminating the lieutenant governor's office in 2013. But it was never approved by the Senate and died.
He's trying again this year. Will things be different with Republican Evelyn Sanguinetti of Wheaton sitting in the No. 2 spot?
It wouldn't take effect until after the 2018 election if voters approved it in 2016. And Republicans are backing the plan to merge the state's comptroller and treasurer offices, too.
Climate question
In an interview this week, U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk, a Highland Park Republican, said he'd like President Barack Obama to back his plan to ban sewage dumping in the Great Lakes.
It was an opportunity to ask Kirk about climate change, given that lately some environmental activists have criticized Kirk for a comment he made to trade publication E&E Daily.
Here's how the publication quoted him: "We had the previous warming period, which was called the global optimum, and the best way to talk about that is when Leif Erickson went west from his home, he discovered a landmass that he called Greenland, because it was. And that was called the global optimum, because the planet was much warmer. By calling Greenland ‘green land,' we know that the climate has been changing pretty regularly within recorded memory."
Kirk's office originally responded with this statement: "Climate change is real and human beings definitely play a role. As I have said since 2010, I will not support a carbon tax or similar attempts which hurt the Illinois or American economy."
This week, before the State of the Union address, Kirk said he didn't want to get into a climate change discussion.
"I would say that my top environmental goal is to back this sewage dumping ban in the Great Lakes," he said.
"I would like people to sit back in another generation and marvel at how pristine the Great Lakes are," he said.

Money men tally cost of climate change
NEW YORK — Climate change is likely to exact enormous costs on U.S. regional economies in the form of lost property, reduced industrial output and more deaths, according to a report backed by a trio of men with vast business experience.
The report, released Tuesday, is designed to convince businesses to factor in the cost of climate change in their long-term decisions and to push for reductions in emissions blamed for heating the planet.
It was commissioned by the Risky Business Project, which describes itself as nonpartisan and is chaired by former New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, former Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Thomas F. Steyer, a former hedge fund manager.
Among the predictions: Between $66 billion and $106 billion in coastal property will likely be below sea level by 2050, labor productivity of outdoor workers could be reduced by 3 percent because extremely hot days will be far more frequent, and demand for electricity to power air conditioners will require the construction of more power plants that will cost electricity customers up to $12 billion per year.
"Every year that goes by without a comprehensive public and private sector response to climate change is a year that locks in future climate events that will have a far more devastating effect on our local, regional, and national economies," warn the report's authors.
The analysis and calculations in the report were performed by the Rhodium Group, an economic research firm, and Risk Management Solutions, a catastrophe-modeling company that works for insurance companies and other businesses. It was paid for by the philanthropic foundations of Bloomberg, Paulson and Steyer, among others.
The report analyzes impacts of climate change by region to better show how climate change affects the businesses and industries that drive each region's economy.
— The Northeast will likely be most affected by sea level rise, which will cost an additional $6 billion to $9 billion in property loss each year.
— The Southeast will likely be affected both by sea-level rise and extreme temperatures. The region, which has averaged eight days of temperatures over 95 degrees each year, will likely see an additional 17 to 52 of these days by midcentury and up to four months of them by the end of the century. This could lead to 11,000 to 36,000 additional deaths per year.
— Higher temperatures will reduce Midwest crop yields by 19 percent by midcentury and by 63 percent by the end of the century.
— The Southwest will see an extra month of temperatures above 95 degrees by 2050, which will lead to more frequent droughts and wildfires.
The report does not calculate the cost of these droughts or wildfires, or many other possible costs such as the loss of unique ecosystems and species and the possible compounding effects of extreme weather conditions. Nor does it calculate some of the ways economies could adapt to the changing climate and reduce the costs of climate change.
"There's a whole litany of things not calculated in the assessment," said Gary Yohe, an economics and environmental studies at Wesleyan University and vice chair of the National Climate Assessment, a U.S. government project set up to study the effects of climate change. Yohe was not part of the Risky Business Project report, but he was asked to review it.
Still, he said, "The general conclusions are right on the money."
And he said that while other groups have also attempted to calculate the financial impacts of climate change around the world, this report is notable because of the business and financial experience of the people behind it. Beyond the three co-chairs, the members of the group's risk committee include Former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, former Cargill CEO Gregory Page, and George Shultz, former treasury secretary and secretary of state.
"These are people who have managed risk all their lives and have made an enormous amount of money doing so," Yohe said.

The candidates vying for the 51st House District seat differ on the graduated income tax amendment, although both oppose any tax on retirement benefits. Incumbent Mary Edly-Allen, a Libertyville Democrat, is facing Chris Bos, a Lake Zurich Republican, in Tuesday's election. The district includes all or portions of the Barrington area, Lake Zurich, Long Grove, Libertyville and Mundelein. The ballot also includes a referendum on a constitutional amendment allowing for a graduated income tax to replace the state's flat tax. 
Gov. J.B. Pritzker's administration calls it the "Fair Tax," saying 97% of taxpayers — those who make under $250,000 per year — would pay the same or less in income taxes under its plan, while wealthier taxpayers would pay more. Edly-Allen supports the graduated tax, which should be coupled with a reduction in spending to protect middle class taxpayers from future tax hikes, she said. "We all want good roads, we all want good bridges, we all want good schools ... we all want all these great services, but who's paying going to pay for them?" she said. Bos said the graduated tax will be detrimental to local businesses and a deterrent to entrepreneurship, with no guarantees against future tax increases on middle- and lower-income residents. "Springfield's proven time and time again that they cannot be trusted," he said. Both candidates said they support legislative ethics reform, including term limits for legislative leaders. Lawmakers should be prohibited from becoming lobbyists after they leave office, both said — for at least one year, Edly-Allen said, or at least two years, Bos said. To help solve the state's pension problem, Bos said, the legislature needs to pass a state constitutional amendment to allow comprehensive reform, and lawmakers should not take their General Assembly pensions. Edly-Allen said the pension problem must be tackled in a bipartisan manner with input from all stakeholders. She's in favor of keeping pension promises, but it's imperative to figure out what can be done moving forward, she said. As for climate change, Bos said humans have an impact on it, while Eldy-Allen said humans cause it. Bos said he supports clean energy technology. Edly-Allen said she supports investing in clean energy programs and jobs that reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Neither candidate expressed support for defunding police. Bos said police must have adequate resources and training, and must understand the needs and concerns of the communities served. The legislature can help provide better jobs in low-income communities and tax relief for property owners and small businesses, he said. Edly-Allen said local police should get more funding for community policing, body cameras and de-escalation training. Also, the state should invest more in programs that provide economic and educational opportunities in minority communities, she said. support legislative ethics reform, including term limits for legislative leaders.

Demonstrators demand that Roskam address climate change

More than 200 people rallied Monday in West Chicago to call on U.S. Rep. Peter Roskam to take action on climate change and support clean energy.
The demonstrators, some of them holding signs with slogans such as "Follow the science" and "Clean energy creates jobs," gathered in a large meeting room down the hall from Roskam's district office at the DuPage Airport before dropping off postcards for the congressman.
"We want to let him know that we think we need to do something about climate change," said Tim Milburn of the Sierra Club Northwest Cook County Group.
Milburn said local Sierra Club chapters organized Monday's rally because they're concerned that President Donald Trump's administration may reverse the progress that's been made on climate change mitigation and clean energy.
Organizers decided to reach out to Roskam because "he's not exactly a climate change proponent," Milburn said. He added that Roskam has "a bad record when it comes to dealing with this environmental issue."
J.C. Kibbey said during the rally that 97 percent of scientists agree that climate change is real.
"Climate change is happening and it is caused by humans," said Kibbey, Midwest outreach and policy advocate for the Union of Concerned Scientists. "There is no continuing debate in the scientific community. And there is no question that the science is conclusive."
To fix the problem, "we need to move to a clean energy economy as soon as possible," he said.
Jack Darin, director of the Sierra Club's Illinois chapter, said everyone who attended the rally is "part of the majority" of residents in Roskam's 6th Congressional District "who want to keep moving forward." The district includes parts of Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake and McHenry counties.
"We want to listen to the scientists and act on climate change," Darin said. "Move beyond dirty fuels to clean energy for all the benefits that it offers to all the citizens of the 6th District, our country and our planet."
While there's a new president, Darin said, people in the 6th District didn't vote to stop creating jobs in solar and wind and energy conservation.
"They didn't vote to opt out of the global effort to stand up and solve climate change," he said.
Therefore, Roskam and other members of Congress should support efforts "to make sure the worst of President Trump's promises will never come true," Darin said.
Roskam wasn't at his district office Monday. According to a spokesman, he was in Washington D.C.
The spokesman issued a statement saying that Roskam supports an "all-of-the-above approach when it comes to energy."
"American ingenuity has made it possible to rid ourselves of our dependence on foreign oil and eliminate a major national security threat," the statement reads. "Each year, new advancements in technology and research allow us to better provide for our energy and security needs while safeguarding our natural resources for the future."

Lake Michigan a boon in climate change era, but faces some risks

It's easy for Illinois residents to take Lake Michigan for granted. Only a sliver of the state fronts it, unlike Michigan and Wisconsin. Many residents might have only seen it on the occasional trip to Chicago. Even suburban residents go years, if not decades, without dipping a toe in it. 
But changes in the climate change Lake Michigan. How much should you worry about that? If you have lakeshore property, maybe a lot. Climate change seems to be leading to more dramatic swings in the lake's water-height cycle, according to Jennifer Caddick, vice president of communications and engagement for the Alliance for the Great Lakes, a nonprofit group devoted to protecting the Great Lakes. If you live inland and are among the millions who drink, cook and water lawns with Lake Michigan water, maybe a little. Some forms of pollution are increasing, but Lake Michigan's depth helps protect against toxic algal blooms that have created dead zones or sent illness-causing bacteria into water supplies in other parts of the Great Lakes. 90% of U.S. fresh water Lake Michigan is one of the five Great Lakes — the world's largest system of freshwater resources. The lakes — nicknamed the "Sweetwater Seas" — account for 19 percent of the world's fresh water and 90 percent of the fresh water in the United States. Lake Michigan is the second-largest in volume, after Lake Superior. It is 307 miles long, 118 miles wide, and reaches a maximum depth of about 925 feet. Breezes that pass over the lake in the summer are noted for cooling off downtown Chicago. Snowstorms passing over open portions in winter pick up moisture, hitting northwest Indiana hard with lake-effect snow. The Illinois International Port District advertises the Port of Chicago as "America's Fourth Coast," handling 19 million tons of cargo a year. Navy Pier says that more than 9 million people visited the entertainment attraction in 2016. We're justly proud of the efforts of architect Daniel Burnham and others, who persuaded politicians to put parks along much of the Chicago shoreline, rather than factories and docks. Infrastructure threatened Lake levels have gone through cycles before, according to historical records. But scientists believe increasing warmth in the atmosphere in North America is leading to more compressed cycles, with higher highs and lower lows. High water levels eat away at beaches, retaining walls and other areas along the shoreline. The Chicago Park District has lost a North Side beach and sustained significant damage to two others and is beginning aerial mapping to study beach erosion. "Those cycles are starting to change in unpredictable ways," Caddick said. When air temperatures are warmer, water temperature increases (and ice coverage decreases). Warm water evaporates more, especially in cooler air in the fall and early winter, according to a report from the Environmental Law and Policy Center. A more-saturated atmosphere leads to heavier, more violent storms. Warmer water helps harmful algae, and some invasive species such as quogga mussels, to thrive. Increased precipitation, particularly heavier events, are increasing pollution flowing into the lake, over the ground and via sanitary-sewage releases, according to Caddick. Some current sewage-treatment systems, especially combined stormwater-sanitary-sewage systems, can't handle the volume of more frequent, heavier storms, she said. To avoid having sewage back up in buildings, they open the gates at treatment plants and release untreated sewage into the lake, or into rivers that lead to the lake. "That's not good to have that extra pollution flowing into our rivers and lakes," Caddick said. Drinking water What about our drinking water? The Metropolitan Planning Council estimates that 6.6 million people in northern Illinois rely on Lake Michigan for drinking water. A 1967 Supreme Court decision enables Illinois to divert up to 2 billion gallons per day, through water plants, the Chicago River and several sewage and shipping canals. Much of the potable water flows through two city of Chicago plants, including 1 billion through the James W. Jardine Water Purification Plant, which is touted as the world's largest. Chicago's plants don't just serve the city; water from them is served up to residents of many Cook suburbs, and nearly all towns in DuPage County. One of the other treatment plants belongs to the Central Lake County Joint Action Water Agency, in Lake Bluff. The plant's interim director, Bill Soucie, doesn't expect climate change to significantly affect the agency's ability to deliver water. "It (the lake) just doesn't change that quickly," Soucie said. His agency draws an average of 19 million gallons a day. The intake devices are located 3,000 feet out from shore, and about 26 feet below the surface. Even if climate change puts more water in the Lake Michigan basin, that's an advantage to his agency; the more water on top of the intakes, the faster it flows to the treatment plant, he said. Soucie said his agency hasn't experienced the troubles other areas throughout the Great Lakes have seen, such as toxic algal blooms. Harmful bacteria from a bloom forced the City of Toledo to turn off drinking water for three days in 2014. The blooms are caused largely by nutrient-laden fertilizer runoff, but warmer water temperatures help them grow, according to Caddick. The Chicago area might be less likely to face that problem, she said, due to much less fertilizer runoff and increased depth. Indirect effect? What if people further inland, running out of water in their aquifers, want to get Lake Michigan water? The 2008 Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact would prevent that. The compact, between the eight Great Lakes states, says that only areas that are in the Great Lakes basin can use its water. (The ability of Illinois plants to send Lake Michigan water to communities outside the basin is governed by the earlier court order.) Only parts of Cook and Lake counties are in the basin. But if a lot of people moved here as climate refugees from areas having significant environmental changes, there could be issues. Illinois uses an average of 76 percent of its allocation, according to the Metropolitan Planning Council. And the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning estimated in 2012 that 22 billion gallons of that was wasted — leaking out of pipes before it ever got to users. Replacing our crumbling public infrastructure would help, but the report notes a lack of willingness or ability to spend the money necessary to do so.

UN chief: Governments must ‘act faster' on climate change UN Secretary General António Guterres says governments around the world are not responding fast enough to address problems of a changing climate. But in an interview with Covering Climate Now, a worldwide consortium of news outlets focusing coverage on climate change this week, he says he sees encouraging signs that citizens are beginning to put the kind of pressure on their leaders that is needed "to make governments understand that they need to run faster." The interviewers included Mark Herstgaard of Climate Change Now, CBS's Mark Phillips, and Amanda Mars, of El País. To see the interview in English, click here.

Images: The impact of climate change Earthquakes, tsunamis, tornadoes, hurricanes, wildfires, droughts, floods and pestilence are nothing new to Planet Earth or even to our comparatively brief human experience here. But, because of humankind's impact on the environment, are these phenomena growing more frequent and more intense? Nature, it has been said, does not need us; we need Nature. These photos show some of what may be in store if we don't get control of the activities that scientists say are changing our climate.

On Monday, April 22, the Environmental Defenders of McHenry County will present the documentary "Chasing Ice" at McHenry County College's Luecht Conference Center, 8900 Route 14, Crystal Lake.
An afternoon showing is planned for 1:30 p.m., and an evening at 7 p.m., with doors opening at 6:30 p.m. The screenings are free and open to the public; donations to help cover costs are accepted.
"Chasing Ice" follows acclaimed environmental photographer James Balog as he heads to the Arctic on assignment for National Geographic. His goal is to capture images that help tell the story of the Earth's changing climate.
A skeptic about global warming when his journey began, Balog discovers undeniable evidence of climate change. Using time-lapse cameras, his videos compress years into seconds and capture ancient mountains of ice in motion as they disappear at a breathtaking rate. The film provides a way to visualize climate change in progress.
An Academy Award nominee, "Chasing Ice" has received many awards since its release last November. This will be the first screening in McHenry County.
This event is sponsored by Environmental Defenders of McHenry County and MCC Down to Earth.
Glacier retreat is the most visible indicator of climate change in the world today. Glaciers are excellent gauges of climate because their retreat, growth, or stasis reflects regional temperature and precipitation patterns.
The vast majority of glaciers in North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Oceania are retreating due to warming temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns, with the rate of ice loss accelerating in recent decades. Humanity is directly and immediately affected by glacier retreat through water resources, sea level, and ocean circulation. It also acts as an early warning of other climate change impacts now accelerating worldwide.
For more information, see "Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States," U.S. Global Change Research Program, at .
Donations are encouraged and are tax-deductible as charitable contributions. For more information, visit or call (815) 338-0393.

‘There is uncertainty, but there is also really, really great certainty. We've ruled out ‘fine.' ‘Fine' is not going to happen' There's a common adage among scientists and statisticians: "All models are wrong, but some are useful." That's certainly true in the modern world, where — despite the fact that they're by nature mere shadows of real-world scenarios — computer models serve as vital guideposts in some of humanity's most complex and dangerous pursuits, from skyscraper and bridge construction to air and space travel. In the world of climate science, models have come under particularly intense scrutiny, with some skeptics dismissing them entirely. 
At the same time, thousands of scientists are banking on these models as guideposts for the planet's future. What makes them so sure? "(Climate) models encapsulate everything we know about how the world works," says Andrew Gettelman, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. The equations that are their foundation are ones we use over and over, and are interwoven in the fabric of our lives. "If we didn't understand thermodynamics and we didn't understand water and how water condenses, internal combustion engines wouldn't work," he says. "If we didn't understand fluid dynamics, we couldn't predict the weather, we couldn't make pipe systems work, and make chemical plants work. None of the physics in climate models is new." That said, today's models are incredibly complex, taking into account a multitude of processes that affect climate, and uncertainty is part of their DNA. They offer a range of scenarios based on human actions — the choices we make around mitigating carbon emission, for instance — but there also is uncertainty in the forecasts each model gives, and a difference in what the top models being used tell us. Take the most basic: long-term global temperature increase. Kate Marvel, a climate scientist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, notes that what the models predict ranges from warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius to 4.5 degrees Celsius — and that gap hasn't materially changed as models have gotten more sophisticated. "That's kind of bonkers," says Marvel. "A degree and a half is not that bad, and 4 1/2 degrees is totally catastrophic." But Marvel, and others, worry that communicating scientific uncertainty to the broader public can be misinterpreted: "There is uncertainty, but there is also really, really great certainty," she says. "We've ruled out ‘fine.' ‘Fine' is not going to happen." Scientists generally welcome uncertainty, says Drew Shindell, a climate scientist at Duke University. Differences among climate models help show the points where they agree, and the elements we can really trust, and the range of results they give help us understand the risks of various actions. "Uncertainty doesn't mean you should not take action because you don't know the outcome," says Shindell. "It means you should be very cautious about the extremes happening because you can't rule them out." Simulated worlds A lot of the confusion about models comes from a misunderstanding of what they are, and what they aim to do, says Gettelman. The models aren't theoretical worlds so much as simulated ones, constrained by laws of physics and chemistry and constantly being validated against observations, recent history, and the deep past. Climate models aren't designed to predict specific weather or events, but they do predict the probability of weather patterns and weather extremes occurring. Today's models require massive supercomputers to run them. The Community Earth System Model Gettelman works on relies on some 1.5 million lines of code. Most climate models break the Earth down into a 3-D grid system, calculating that system for grids at various longitudes and latitudes and heights into the atmosphere. As the models improve, those grids get ever finer and incorporate more elements of the climate system. These simulations have come a long way from the basic energy-balance model that Svante Arrhenius, a Swedish scientist, used to demonstrate the greenhouse effect back in the 1890s. But in essence, they're not that different from the far more basic climate models that scientists were using four or five decades ago. "At their heart, (models) follow basic physical laws that are very well understood," says Shindell. "We have theory and we have observation and we have measurements in the real world that all hold together." Kicking the tires Rather than blindly trusting the models out there, climate scientists are constantly questioning them, says Katharine Hayhoe, co-director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University. "The more you know about models, the less you trust them, and the more you kick their tires," Hayhoe says. She knows what they're good at, like simulating observed changes in temperature and the jet stream. And she knows what they do less well, such as modeling how quickly the ice sheets are melting or the rate that Arctic sea ice is lost. In those cases, as with extreme precipitation, many models actually are underestimating how fast things are changing, says Hayhoe. Models are also better at predicting changes over a bigger time and space scale than they are at forecasting those changes for smaller regions, or the nearer-term future. And, when it comes to the big differences among what the models tell us, scientists are getting better at understanding where that gap comes from. One of the major reasons: clouds. The clouded view Clouds have become a huge focus of many climate scientists because of the large impact they have on climate. But cloud formations are incredibly complicated to model reliably. Clouds have a warming effect, because they act like a blanket over the Earth. But they also have a cooling effect, as white clouds reflect solar energy away. The net effect of clouds on the planet tends to be cooling, explains Gettelman, and it's a huge effect. "Small changes to clouds can really magnify or damp what we do with carbon dioxide," he says. Given all that, clouds are one of the most important things for a climate model to get right, but also one of the hardest. The scale at which clouds form is tiny: liquid water droplets crystallizing around a dust grain. "That is incredibly small scale," Dr. Marvel says, "but of course climate models need to simulate the entire climate, which is the largest scale you can get, and those don't match very well together." To get around that, models approximate clouds in various ways, but it's an imperfect science, and much of modelers' efforts these days go into improving and refining those approximations. They're also starting to bring in other key parts of the climate system, like the biological processes involved in the carbon cycle — how natural land- and ocean-based carbon sinks may shift in the future. Building a virtual planet Despite all these uncertainties, scientists emphasize that the models are consistent on the most basic points: The Earth is warming. We'll get more days of extreme temperatures, with dangerous levels of heat. And there will be more extreme precipitation events. What's perhaps most disconcerting to many climate scientists is the fact that with the most recent generation of models, which have worked hard to incorporate more processes and reduce structural uncertainties, many have started running "hotter" — showing temperature changes in the long term of 5 or 6 degrees C instead of 4 degrees — and it's not yet clear why that is. These newer models might be more accurate, Marvel says, but without fully understanding why what they're telling us has changed, she doesn't think their results can be totally accepted. But what scientists emphasize over and over is that while the models they work with may not be perfect — and are almost certainly "wrong" at some level — they offer us the most complete, and validated, way we have of understanding our climate trajectory. In essence, the models are the laboratories that climate scientists use. Earth scientists can't build anything in the real world that replicates our entire system, so "in order to conduct experiments on our planet, we have to build a virtual planet," Hayhoe says. Climate models "are like alternative Earths that we can run what-if experiments on," she continues, "which further underscores the fact that we are currently running an unprecedented, although inadvertent, experiment with our actual planet, which is the only home that we have." * This story originally appeared in Christian Science Monitor and is republished here as part of Covering Climate Now, a global journalistic collaboration to strengthen coverage of the climate story.

SEQUOIA NATIONAL FOREST, Calif. — In parts of California's Sierra Nevada, marshy meadows are going dry, wildflowers are blooming earlier and glaciers are melting into ice fields.
Scientists also are predicting the optimal temperature zone for giant sequoias will rise hundreds and hundreds of feet, leaving trees at risk of dying over the next 100 years.
As indicators point toward a warming climate, scientists across 4 million acres of federally protected land are noting changes affecting everything from the massive trees that can grow to more than two-dozen feet across to the tiny, hamsterlike pika. But what the changes mean and whether humans should do anything to intervene are sources of disagreement among land managers.
"That's the tricky part of the debate: If humans are causing warming, does that obligate us under the laws of the National Park Service to try to counteract those effects?" said Nate Stephenson, a research ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey.
"How do you adapt to a changing climate if you're a national park?" added Stephenson, who is 30 years into a study of trees in the largest wilderness in the continental U.S., Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park.
Since 1895, the average temperature across California has increased by 1.7 degrees, and experts say the most visible effects of that warming occur within the Sierra Nevada, where low temperatures are rising and precipitation increasingly falls as rain rather than snow. Some models show noncoastal California warming by 2.7 degrees between 2000 and 2050, one of many reasons President Obama pledged last week to use executive powers to cut carbon pollution.
The state's two largest rivers — the Sacramento and San Joaquin — originate in the Sierra. The range also is home to Lake Tahoe, the largest alpine lake in North America; Mount Whitney, the highest peak in the Lower 48; and the nation's only groves of giant sequoias, the largest living things on earth.
There are mounting concerns about the beloved sequoias, whose sprawling, 10-foot-deep root systems make them especially vulnerable to drought and heat.
Because the trees exist only in such a small region, scientists are debating whether to irrigate the 65 groves in the southern Sierra to help them endure warmer temperatures.
Otherwise they fear the trees could die. During the last warm, dry period 4,000 to 10,000 years ago, their numbers were greatly diminished, according to pollen evidence collected by researchers at Northern Arizona University.
"Whether we would water them certainly comes up on our climate change scenario planning," said Koren Nydick, science coordinator at Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park. "They are a very unusual species because they're also looked on as a social artifact."
Stephenson says his decades of studying conifers in Sequoia National Forest have shown they are dying at twice their historic rate, partly because the climate is warmer and dryer.
The giant sequoias grow much more slowly than conifers over many hundreds of years so changes have been tougher to recognize, though researchers suspect seedlings already may be having a harder time taking root.
"That's always the million-dollar question," said Stephenson, director of USGS's Sierra Nevada Global Change Research Program. "We just don't have a big enough sample size to know what's going on with the giant sequoias, whereas we monitor thousands of pines and firs and have much more confidence."
So far, the dozens of changes researchers have noted, in everything from earlier songbird fledging dates to greater wildfire intensity, may point to a warming climate. But it's far from understood whether that would mean doom or adaptation for California's ecological heart.
"I don't want to say that because we're seeing one thing, that's how it will play out," said Rob Klinger who is studying alpine mammals for the USGS's Western Ecological Research Center. "The endgame of our study is determining whether there will be uniform change or will it be patchwork. If you look at evolutionary time scales, species have gone through these changes before, and they handle it."
As part of a Ph.D. project at the University of California, Merced, Kaitlin Lubetkin for five summers has hiked the backcountry taking inventory of 350 subalpine meadows formed when glaciers retreated eons ago. The marshy ground acts as a reservoir that eases flooding after snow melts, and the stored water feeds streams during dry months and sustains wildlife such as the endangered willow flycatcher songbird and the Yosemite toad, which is being considered for threatened species status.
Over the past decade of warmer, drier conditions, however, pine trees have begun to take root, acting like straws to pull the moisture out of the meadows, Klinger and Lubetkin have observed.
"Pretty much right up to the tree line you're getting encroachment in every meadow," said Lubetkin.
In September, Hassan Basagic of the Glaciers of the American West Project will be hiking to 12,000 feet elevation to measure the Lyell Glacier in Yosemite National Park and monitor the changes he first began observing in the early 2000s. Scientists from Yosemite National Park and the University of Colorado recently noted that the glacier is no longer moving — and is melting — by using measurements they've made over the past four years, as well as some of Basagic's earlier work.
Basagic's used photos from the 1930s to show that in the early 2000s the rate at which the Sierra's glaciers were receding picked up.
"A lot of people call glaciers the `canary in the coal mine.' They're an indicator that the alpine climate is changing," said Basagic, who monitors glacial changes for Portland State University research projects. "With that change, other things will change, like the plants and animals that depend on certain climatic conditions."
Already the American pika, a cold-loving rodent, is moving to higher elevations, and a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service report says, "Climate change is a potential threat to the long-term survival."
The USGS's Klinger, however, said pikas might be more resilient than the wildlife service predicts. "It doesn't hibernate and it has dealt with expanding and contracting snow packs and changing temperatures — and yet it persists," Klinger said.
If the trends continue, some species are expected to adapt by finding more hospitable environments, scientists say. One potential place is Devil's Postpile National Monument in the eastern Sierra, where 40 data collection devices are showing that temperature inversions caused by atmospheric pressure are filling the region of steep canyons with colder air.
Scientists are studying whether other areas with similar features might serve as refuges for some species. They're looking at establishing seed banks in the 800-acre park where several climatic regions overlap and more than 400 plants, 100 birds and 35 animals coexist.
"We have an incredible living laboratory to understand what's happening with this cold air pool," said monument Superintendent Deanna Dulen. "We're really trying to get a good baseline of knowledge so we can look at the changes over time. We have the potential to be a refuge, but also to be a place of increased vulnerability. There's so much to learn."

Dave Lowe found measurable proof of climate change 50 years ago. He's watched in horror ever since.

There's a certificate on the wall of Dave Lowe's small cottage in Petone, Wellington, New Zealand. It could easily be missed by a passing guest. But if they cared to take a second glance, three words would immediately jump out: Nobel Peace Prize. It's the 2007 Prize, awarded to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Lowe was a lead author on their largest-ever report. 
It was by far the greatest honor of his career. He resigned almost immediately afterward, walking away on top of the scientific world. The Prize is a testament to all that he has achieved in his career, but at the same time, to him, it's a haunting reminder of all the things he didn't, or couldn't, change. "I've lived this horror for 50 years," he says. "There's so little time left and we've just been so bloody stupid." Dave Lowe was one of the first people on Earth to find measurable proof that human activities were changing the atmosphere and warming the planet. For the past 50 years, he has watched on, helpless and frustrated, as the situation around him has gotten worse, and worse, and worse. Volcano over clouds The world's largest volcano dominates the skyline of Hawaii's Big Island. The huge, sloping sides and gigantic crater of Mauna Loa cast an imposing shadow and send a constant warning across the Pacific paradise. The Ancient Hawaiians believed Mauna Loa was created by the volcano goddess Pele, who formed it at such an immense height so she could escape the wrath of her sister Namaka, the sea goddess. According to one legend, Pele is accompanied by a phantom white dog. When an eruption was soon to occur, she would send her dog down the mountain to warn the people of the impending disaster. In 1958, an American scientist named Charles David Keeling climbed Mauna Loa, and changed the world's understanding of our climate forever. Keeling had spent the better part of the 1950s perfecting a system of measuring exactly how much of which gases make up Earth's atmosphere. By adapting gas analyzers used in coal mines, he was able to take the first reliable reading of the amount of carbon dioxide in the air. It was here, in two simple gray buildings set against a desolate, otherworldly landscape, that Keeling established the world's first permanent station to measure CO2 levels. The gas analyzer splits a sample of air into 1 million parts, and counts how many of those are CO2. The first measurement Keeling took read 313 parts per million. Then, as he continued to take regular readings, he saw something no one had ever seen before. The planet was breathing. In autumn, as the leaves died off the trees, the amount of CO2 in the air would rise. Then in spring, as the plants grew again, the number would fall again. In and out, like lungs exhaling. Then, when a full year had gone by and the cycle was complete, he checked the number again. It never returned to 313. Now, it sat at 314 ppm. He had just uncovered the first piece of evidence that the total amount of CO2 in the air was increasing. That matters because CO2 has an insulating effect in the atmosphere. It traps heat, which is why it's called a greenhouse gas. More CO2 means more heat. Every year without fail, for the last 61 years, the number has continued to climb. The chart that tracks the rising CO2, that drumbeat on the march to climate breakdown, is called the Keeling Curve. Some would say that the legends of Mauna Loa are true. Pele's white dog has become Keeling's gas analyzer, high in the mountains among the ancient volcanic rock, sending out a warning signal to tell the people of the coming disaster. A worldwide search While Keeling was tracking the first evidence of climate change on a Hawaiian volcano, Dave Lowe was a teenage high school dropout in Taranaki, New Zealand, with only one thing on this mind: surfing. "You go out there and man, do you get a feeling for the environment. I saw the atmosphere directly, going down into the ocean, mixing the sounds, the smells." Sitting on his board, staring out at the mist and the ocean spray dancing against the pink hues of the setting sun, he decided he needed to understand more about the world around him. He went back to school and earned a physics honors degree from Victoria University of Wellington. Lowe and Keeling's paths would cross for the first time in 1970. By this time, Keeling was a giant in his field. But he wasn't satisfied with his research station at Mauna Loa. One measurement at one specific location wasn't enough evidence. He wanted a global record, in both hemispheres, so he could confirm what he was seeing, and track it for future decades. Lowe was a 23-year-old graduate at the former Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, recruited to join Keeling's team as they set up the world's second continuous record of atmospheric CO2. They found a spot about 30 minutes out of Wellington city, near Makara Beach, at the World War II-era gun emplacements of Fort Opau. The first failed attempts to record atmospheric CO2 in New Zealand were made at Fort Opau, a gun emplacement built in 1941 to protect the Wellington harbor. After six months training in California, Lowe returned to join the small American team of one scientist and two technicians. But pretty soon he found himself with far more responsibility than he expected. "The scientist would constantly just bugger off back to San Diego for six months at a time. And the technicians, well ... they were being paid to have the holiday of their lives. They were always off hunting and fishing, not to speak of the marijuana. "I was thrown in the deep end trying to run hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of gear on a really important project which is being funded millions by the National Science Foundation." But that work was for nothing. The readings at Makara were erratic, showing wild swings and no discernible pattern. They were useless. There was about a kilometer of paddocks between the sea and the analyzer that was sucking up too much CO2 and throwing off the readings. Keeling told him he needed to develop a new portable gas analyzer and find a new location, undisturbed by vegetation or outside sources. After some searching, Lowe found the spot he was looking for at Baring Head, a peninsula an hour out of Wellington in the opposite direction, at the base of the Remutaka Forest Park. It was perfect. At the right time, Baring Head gets air currents directly from Antarctica, an incredible undisturbed run through hundreds of kilometers of the Southern Ocean. The first thing they learned was that Baring Head always measured a few ppm behind Mauna Loa. The majority of emissions are produced in the northern hemisphere; this showed that it took time for those gases to spread south. They also found that Baring Head didn't show the same huge seasonal swings as the Mauna Loa readings. The huge continents of vegetation in the northern hemisphere were affecting the Hawaiian readings, but the measurements in the South Pacific, surrounded by ocean, were far more stable. Yet the most important thing was that in both the south and the north, the carbon in the atmosphere was slowly rising. James Renwick is a professor of geology at Victoria University, who was also a contributor to the 2007 Nobel Prize and received last year's Prime Minister's Science Prize. He says Lowe is "a bit of a legend in NZ atmospheric science," and his contributions to the global record of climate change were invaluable. "At the time I suspect it wasn't appreciated just how important the Baring Head Station was, but now the climate science community really values the long time series from Baring Head." "That's very significant," he says. "They are a part of a global network of observing sites that have taught us many things. Dave Lowe has been a real pioneer in atmospheric science in NZ, especially around measurement of greenhouse gases and in understanding the chemistry of the atmosphere and how that's changing." The grind Finding himself in charge of a groundbreaking research with barely any experience, Lowe put everything on his own shoulders. Together with his friend and colleague Peter Gunther, they were basically running the entire southern arm of the operation alone, and they were fully aware of how important their work was. That meant constant flights between Wellington and California, reading every background paper that had ever been written on the subject, developing all the computer programs to drive the calculations. "We worked our butts off," he says. "I knew that I just had to do this. I threw everything I had into it." But that intensity had its consequences. Eventually, something had to give. The single-minded drive Lowe had dedicated to his pursuit of science cost him his marriage. "I just kept on going as my marriage crashed. I was a real mess. A hell of a mess. I was working too hard, and completely blown apart emotionally. "The guy I was working for took a look at me and said, ‘Dave, you're no good to me at all in your condition.'" Proof or persuasion In 1975, Lowe took a sabbatical to recover from his professional and personal blowout. He attended the first scientific conference of greenhouse gas experts. He reckons he's probably the only person at the meeting who is still alive. The small group knew what was coming before anyone else in the world. They had proved that mankind was changing the chemical makeup of the air, and they knew the inevitable outcome of that. The terms "global warming" and "climate change" hadn't been invented yet, but that's exactly what they were seeing. In the following years, Lowe moved to Germany to study further, and met his now-wife Irena. They've been married for 40 years. He specialized in isotopic techniques, which he describes as like DNA tracing for gas particles. Not all the CO2 in the atmosphere is from the burning of fossil fuels. For most of human history, the CO2 level has naturally fluctuated between 200 and 300 ppm, which we know thanks to air samples trapped in glacier ice cores. Those natural fluctuations are often cited by climate deniers to suggest that climate change is not man-made. Naturally occurring carbon is made up of different isotopes. The most common types are called Carbon-12 and Carbon-13. Carbon-12 is by far the most common type found in nature. Carbon-13 makes up about 1% of the total. But the exact amount can differ. There is slightly less Carbon-13 in fossil fuels like coal and oil compared to in atmospheric carbon. Lowe and other international researchers found that while total CO2 in the air was increasing, the percentage of Carbon-13 isotopes compared to Carbon-12 was decreasing. That proved that the additional CO2 in the atmosphere was coming from the burning of fossil fuels by humans, not anything else. "That's the smoking gun. You can get every skeptic blue in the face, but that's just open and shut evidence that this extra CO2 came from humans," he says. That was proof, settled science. But the battle to convince the public of his findings was only just beginning. Part of the problem was that the predicted temperature rise didn't show up for several years. While CO2 was rising, the mercury was jumping up and down, with no consistency. But eventually, the signal separated from the noise and the heat started to climb. Once it did, it basically never stopped. In hindsight, the conservative approach of the scientific community probably held progress back for a number of years, he says. "As a scientists, we thought, ‘No, you don't jump up and down and scream; we're not activists.' Losing our credibility was the big issue. "It was a totally different time. If only I knew then what I know now ... . Now it's different. Many of us are out there doing stuff. We have to. This is an emergency." Full-blown arguments with climate change deniers have been a common occurrence in Lowe's life. His voice bristles with frustration when the topic comes up. "It's better now, but it was hard yards. I'd be yelled at by people. It used to be constant shouting matches with skeptics. "(Scientists) deal in data and facts and graphs and numbers, it's really hard to get through with that. In my lifetime I've given hundreds of climate change talks and you're always up against it with this distrust." Nothing grinds his gears more than scientists in the 1980s and 1990s who deliberately spread mistruths about climate change while on the payrolls of oil companies, like Fred Singer and others profiled in the 2010 book "Merchants of Doubt." "I just think ... the bastard, how dare he not look at the facts. That makes me angry, people who deliberately go out and falsify what's going on." After resigning, Lowe started his own small family business, consulting and doing climate change education. After his children left home, he and Irena moved into their small cottage, which they meticulously designed to have the smallest possible carbon footprint. He's still actively involved in climate science, making submissions on bills and helping with various research work. He's working on a book about his life work. Every day as he sits down to write, that Nobel Peace Prize certificate hangs behind him. "I just wish ... all of us wish, that we could have changed minds," he says. "But how do you fight an oil company?" The first ever CO2 reading at Baring Head was 326 parts per million. The most recent reading was 409 parts per million. * This is republished here as part of Covering Climate Now, a global journalistic collaboration to strengthen coverage of the climate story.

The front cover of the latest issue of Backpacker Magazine reads "How to Hike In the Era of Climate Change." Indeed, after decades of the alarm being sounded, the reality of climate change is becoming very evident — and the emergency is in the news almost daily. That was not the case when I visited Alaska in the summer of 1989. Back then I was living in the Bahamas and flew, guilt-free, from there to Anchorage. 
I spent a month hitching and hiking around Alaska, and my hike along the Exit Glacier to the Harding Icefield is still one of the most memorable hikes of my life. In the last dozen years, the Exit Glacier has been retreating hundreds of feet annually. The park service had already stopped adding extensions to the Exit Glacier trail in 2010 because the toe of the glacier had become surrounded by treacherous terrain. Having said all that, I'd still love to take my kids on that hike, along what's left of the Exit Glacier to what's left of the Harding Icefield. But, in the era of climate change, should I go back to Alaska? These days, I believe that if you do go somewhere hiking, then that place should be somehow better off for you having been there. And the further afield you go, the more good you need to do. In other words, if you are going to hike it, then you need to do something to save it, too. We can't travel guilt-free anymore. Those days are long gone. Certainly, when we travel to a place, our presence uses local resources and creates waste. So, an obvious remediation activity when traveling can be to participate in some kind of official (or unofficial) clean-up effort. Contributing to a local organization that addresses resource conservation is another option. Of course, exacerbating climate change by traveling is sort of an ugly, catch-22 of nature-based tourism. We are kinda loving these places to death by visiting them. So, offsetting travel-related carbon emissions needs to be on every hiker's to-do list. I suggest "earning" your trip by working to reduce your personal emissions throughout the year. Driving less, flying less, buying local and eating less meat are all things we should be doing anyway — so a big trip can add even more incentive to do those things. Finally, it's still very important to be talking about climate change with your friends and family. Tell them about what you are seeing it do to the places you love. Tell them about what is being lost. Do your best to make them care. We have that responsibility. Likely, no one reading this is living a carbon-neutral lifestyle. So, we are not perfect when it comes to "leaving only footprints" But we nature-lovers, more than any group, should be leading by example when we travel. If we are not, then why should we expect more from anyone else? * Mike Baltz has a doctorate in biology and writes about changing the world from his home in Carbondale.

As we enter the final month leading up to the 2020 presidential election, the nationâ€™s attention has been drawn to a series of pre-election debates. Climate change was a hotly discussed topic during the October 7th Vice Presidential Debate between Kamala Harris and Mike Pence, with both sides claiming that they were backing â€˜science.â€™ However, the messages they were taking from the science were significantly different. While Harris supports a version of the sweeping Green New Deal, Pence prefers to protect the environment through protecting the economy and exploring alternative fossil fuels such as natural gas. How can two campaigns each look at the same scientific â€˜factsâ€™ and draw such vastly different conclusions?
 It turns out, a lot of the disagreements are not about the facts at all, but over how drastic the impacts of climate change are expected to be. The Trump Administrationâ€™s analysis of the science of global warming is that the health of the economy poses a much more potent risk than the unknowns of climate change. However, the fact that the consequences of climate change are often unpredictable should lead to more concern, not less â€" as accurate as global warming models have become, there will likely be impacts that nobody could have predicted. The economy is famously bad at responding to unpredictable catastrophes; protecting the global climate now will in turn protect the economy in the future. But just how drastic are the consequences of climate change expected to be? Drastic enough to justify the $2 trillion modified Green New Deal that the Biden campaign is proposing? To answer this, letâ€™s dive into what the climate change models expect the impact of global climate change to be on northern Illinois (including Lake County). The EPA reported in 2016 ¹ that on average, temperatures in Illinois have already increased by one degree Fahrenheit over the past century. However, the most drastic changes are likely to come from precipitation patterns: the bulk of rainfall is going to shift from the summer to the spring, and be more consolidated into heavy rainstorms. One significant impact of this will be the flooding of local watersheds; to read more about how this will impact the Des Plaines River and Libertyville, you can read my blog on â€œthe Des Plaines Riverâ€™s Flooding Problemâ€ at https://marclos.github.io/Climate_Change_Narratives/F2020/Burns.html. Illinoisâ€™ agricultural economy is particularly vulnerable to the double whammy of rain shifts and temperature change. Hatfield (2014) ² describes how earlier rainfall will impact planting times, and more frequent rainstorms and high summer heat risks damaging crops. Even short term exposure to these sorts of stressors result on average in a 15-20% loss in crop yield, which would have a significant impact on Illinoisâ€™ $84 billion annual agriculture industry. As a highly agricultural economy, Illinois clearly has a lot to lose if climate change is allowed to continue unabated. By implementing green infrastructure today â€" such as through a Green New Deal, costly as it is â€" regions such as Illinois can avoid significant economic ramifications of global warming in the future. It just makes good sense. 1 Environmental Protection Agency.
