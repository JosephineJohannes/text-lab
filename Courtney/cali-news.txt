This has been a year marked by terrifying news about climate change: extreme weather, massive wildfires, persistent drought in some areas and catastrophic flooding in others.
The sense of impending doom was made official when the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that the world is almost certain to blow past the target set by the 2015 Paris Agreement of holding the increase in global temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius above the 19th century level.
That was "a code red for humanity," U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned. "Global heating is affecting every region on Earth, with many of the changes becoming irreversible."
And yet, as improbable as it seems, there are glimmers of hope on the horizon.
Public opinion has moved, partly because more people now have firsthand experience with the effects of climate change. A poll sponsored by Yale and George Mason universities reported this month that a record 76% of Americans think global warming is real; only 12% think it isn't.
"Denialism," the dismissal of climate change as bogus, is dying.
An increasing number of Americans want their political leaders to do something about climate change. A Pew Research Center poll in May found that almost two-thirds say it should be treated as a top priority.
That's tempered by the fact that Americans rank plenty of other issues -- beginning with the economy and COVID-19 -- as "top priorities."
But among Democrats and young voters especially, climate has become a core issue. They want their government to act.
Political leaders follow the poll numbers. In Europe, climate is a serious priority for almost all major parties. In the United States, the issue is polarizing; many Republicans are still skeptical. But for Democrats like President Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, acting against climate change has become a must-do.
Next month, many of those politicians, including Biden, will head to the Scottish city of Glasgow for a summit meeting. The purpose is to win new commitments for action -- especially from China, the industrial behemoth that burns more coal than the rest of the world combined.
The good news there is that China, which has long proclaimed its intention to clean up its energy sector someday, is increasingly a global outlier.
The International Energy Agency, which once championed fossil fuel industries, now says demand for oil, gas and coal could peak within a decade -- thanks mostly to the rise of solar, wind and other low-carbon technologies.
"There is increasing optimism in the climate and energy communities that [carbon dioxide] emissions have plateaued or are now plateauing," Dagomar Degroot, an environmental historian at Georgetown University, told me last week. "Scenarios that forecast soaring emissions now seem implausible."
That doesn't mean the problem is solving itself, he warned.
"Warming will continue until we release fewer emissions than can be absorbed. ... That threshold still seems to be decades away. We need to work harder to bring it closer."
But while there's not much optimism in the short term, the long-run goal of slowing and then reversing global warming no longer looks unreachable. The problem can be solved with tools we have: evolving technologies, efficiency and conservation.
The environmental movement's problem now, perversely, isn't denialism; it's "doomism," the view that the planet's collapse is inevitable, and efforts to prevent catastrophe are futile.
"Fear-based messaging" was once useful because it grabbed people's attention, but now it risks getting in the way, Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist of the Nature Conservancy, told me. Her new book, "Saving Us," makes a case for hope.
Doomism "isn't helpful when it leads to inaction," she said. "We're not just tied to the railway track, where there's nothing we can do. We're in the locomotive with our hand on the throttle. We have the ability to take our hand off the throttle and put our foot on the brake.
"We can't avoid all the impacts, because some of them are here today. But we absolutely can avoid the worst impacts," Hayhoe added.
The next three decades will still be hard. The IPCC report described five possible scenarios for the rest of this century; even the most optimistic forecasts that temperatures will continue to rise through at least 2050. The five "best estimates" for the year 2100 were temperature increases ranging from 1.4 to 4.4 degrees Celsius.
The question for the politicians who are about to gather in Glasgow is: How much will they do to reduce those numbers? Which scenario do they want to bequeath to their successors -- and to their grandchildren?
But it's just possible that this decade could be remembered as one in which humans solved a collective problem and began to tame climate change. That, at least, provides grounds for hope.

CALIFORNIA DROUGHT; The driest year in a century; Exceptionally low accumulation of rain and snow across the state is exacerbated by climate change, reviving fears of emergency measures

In a year of both extreme heat and extreme drought, California has reported its driest water year in terms of precipitation in a century, and experts fear the coming 12 months could be even worse.
The Western Regional Climate Center added average precipitation reported at each of its stations and calculated that a total of 11.87 inches of rain and snow fell in California in the 2021 water year. That's half of what experts deem average during a water year in California: about 23.58 inches.
The climate center tallies rainfall by averaging all of the measured precipitation in the state at the end of a water year, which runs Oct. 1 through Sept. 30.
Based on the diminished levels of both precipitation and runoff, the last water year was the second driest on record, according to the California Department of Water Resources.
The last time the state reported so little rain and snowfall was in 1924.
Climatologists have compared the drought conditions that spanned 2020 and 2021 to the 1976-77 drought, which included California's lowest level of statewide runoff in a single water year.
The average rainfall in 1976-77 was 28.7 inches; in 2020-21, it was 28.2 inches.
A federal report placed the economic losses from the 1976-77 drought over $1 billion, and some feared that drought could cripple the state's water system.
The current multiyear drought has revived the same fears, as reservoirs are depleted and emergency drought proclamations have been issued in 50 of California's 58 counties. Gov. Gavin Newsom has called on Californians to voluntarily reduce water use by 15%, and state officials say they may impose mandatory water restrictions if dryness continues this winter.
"The history of California has been written in long droughts," said Bill Patzert, a retired climatologist who worked for decades at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory studying the effects of climate change. "There's a lot of water, but it comes down to how it's used."
The U.S. Drought Monitor, a map updated weekly showing drought- related conditions in the United States, indicates that over 87% of California is experiencing extreme or exceptional drought, with nearly half the state in the worst category.
Less rain has meant less water, especially in areas such as the Colorado River, an important source of imported water for Southern California.
Nevada's Lake Mead, a major water source for Los Angeles and the West, has been declining since 2000, and recovery is grim, experts say. Even if a great water year was on the way, "you're not even going to come close to refilling Lake Mead," said Daniel McEvoy, a climatologist with the Western Regional Climate Center.
All but two of California's major reservoirs are below their average storage level. Lake Oroville, the second-largest reservoir in the state, is at a record low. And Lake Shasta, the largest reservoir, is critically low -- although not as low as it was in 1977, McEvoy said.
But unlike in 1977, the drought effects have been worsened by accelerated climate change. Increasingly warmer temperatures have evaporated precipitation and melted snowpack much faster than in previous years, according to a study by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
"The warm temperatures that have helped make this drought so intense and widespread will continue (and increase) until stringent climate mitigation is pursued and regional warming trends are reversed," the study says.
California recorded its hottest summer this year, and the extreme heat has parched the landscape.
And as the newest water year begins, the state could be in for more of the same. La Nina conditions that typically bring dry winters to California and the Southwest have emerged in the Pacific Ocean, NOAA reported Thursday.
"We've already had this dry year, we're in a drought situation, and then trends are that it potentially could be below the low rainfall season again this winter," said Jayme Laber, senior hydrologist with the National Weather Service's office in Oxnard. "All those things add up to not looking good."
NOAA climatologists forecast the present drought to last into 2022 and potentially longer. And though California eventually will get wetter, experts say an extreme weather change is needed to get the state back to normal.
"It's going to take a while ... until we start getting some rain, and enough rain where we start recharging groundwater basins or getting enough rainfall that we start seeing water in our rivers and streams again," Laber said.
Jeanine Jones, the interstate resources manager for the Department of Water Resources, said the state would need about 140% of its average precipitation to reset the water table.
Precipitation varies across California, and the dry Southern California climate is much different from the wet and snowy Sierra Nevada. In an average year, three-quarters of the state's precipitation falls in Northern and Central California, mostly in the Sierra, NASA experts say.
But Southern California has the highest annual variability of precipitation in the United States, meaning that any year could swing wildly from wet to dry conditions.
"As scientists think about the long-term effects of climate change, one of the expectations is that this variability will be enhanced," Jones said. Or, as she likes to put it, "the extremes become more extreme."

OPERA REVIEW; Our time in the sun; A brief, sold-out run of the climate change opera 'Sun & Sea' proves scorching.

We have in Santa Monica, in America, throughout the climate-catastrophizing developed world, a pleasure problem we dare not address. Sure, we have to find solutions. But must we give up dairy and almonds, let alone meat? Our cellphone? A good chunk of our Netflix-Spotify-Facebook-Instagram-Google-Apple-Amazon-bitcoin digital life? Overseas vacations? Cars? And pretty much the rest of what we're convinced makes life worth living?
For all the high-minded talk promised by COP26, the climate change conference to be held in Glasgow next month, we still, inevitably, bury our heads in the sand.
Which brings us to "Sun & Sea." The Lithuanian installation opera proved a sensation at the Venice Biennale two years ago and just finished an American tour at the Museum of Contemporary Art's Geffen Contemporary. It is an opera for a few. An hour long, it was given five times a night, accommodating an audience of only 102 for each performance. The $25 tickets for the 15 performances Thursday though Saturday sold out in minutes. Funnily, a work about the horrors of global heating was said to be the hottest ticket in town.
In the end, what makes "Sun & Sea" horrifying is that a leisurely day at the beach is depicted not with the terrors of climate change but with the ostensible lack of them. It is an opera about caring but not doing, about environmental ennui, which just may turn out to be our biggest threat of all.
The production required a considerable effort, much of which has its own carbon footprint. Three institutions have admirably collaborated: the Center for the Art of Performance at UCLA, the Hammer Museum and MOCA, which has allowed tons of sand to be schlepped into its Geffen Contemporary space in Little Tokyo.
On it lounge a couple dozen beachgoers on their towels. They have their books, phones, games, popcorn and other snacks. They tan, parade and snuggle in their bikinis, trunks and whatnot. A surfer dons a wetsuit. Kids run around. Couples are lovey-dovey or simply together, the audience invited to parse their dynamics.
It is a rainbow beach. You couldn't ask for a better representation of age, body type, race, sexual orientation and personality. The eye is drawn to the panorama, which seems to promise a utopian society. At the same time, the eye is drawn to the individuals, each seeming like someone you might like to meet.
We will meet them, but not in the typical way of opera, in which an audience is beckoned into an unfamiliar milieu. "Sun & Sea," however influenced it may be by Pina Bausch and Robert Wilson, operates at a greater psychological distance than a proscenium stage allows (even from the nosebleed seats). We stand on a high perch. We're the gods peering down on the beach below as its denizens blithely foretell their own destruction. We're not omnipotent gods, just the fools who set everything in motion, observing the process for our own amusement.
On the libretto handed out, the three creators of the opera -- Rugile Barzdziukaite, Vaiva Grainyte and Lina Lapelyte -- do not bother to distinguish their roles. They are, respectively, director, librettist and composer. It is decidedly meant to be an opera by all three, not, as would be typical for an opera, Lapelyte's "Sun & Sea."
The reason for that might be discovered by purchasing the recording of "Sun & Sea" on Bandcamp. The music sounds deceptively plain, if intriguing. The electronic accompaniment is minimalism at its seemingly banal blandest -- Satie or Philip Glass reduced to beginner rhythms and harmonies. That is apparently part of Lapelyte's devious plan. Cutting to the bone, she gets her music ingeniously under your skin.
The characters on the beach are a desultory bunch. A few actively have fun. Most, though, basically lie and bake, lounge and ruminate.
It is midday. The light is so direct and intense that no level of sunscreen is likely to be dermatologist recommended.
You have to scan the faces of each beachgoer in all the 23 short numbers -- be they solos, ensemble numbers or choruses -- to figure out who is singing, which is a brilliant way to force the observer to always be taking in the big picture.
The vocal settings are plain as well, with qualities again of Glass and Satie, along with hints of Robert Ashley, Broadway, elemental pop song and plainchant. We hear a "siren" muse on the odd drowning of her ex. A wealthy woman boasts of taking her kid (who looks bored to tears) on expensive packaged tours to the world's great beaches. Her workaholic husband is determined to keep his cool, unlikely as that seems. A philosopher's commentary sounds like a parody of a philosopher's commentary. Someone shares an uncooked dream. A complainer has her litanies. Much of this text is wry, funny, cannily observant and eminently singable.
Most mainly sing of and to their self-obsessed selves. Vacationers' choruses, even when they bring in welcome counterpoint, are the flattest statements of all, warnings of riptides, notes about the airport.
Yet a barely perceptible collective hint of the ominous pervades. These beachgoers know that the sand in Santa Monica will be gone and the pier underwater due to rising sea levels. The grandchildren of the children on the beach may very well have no beach.
Do they care? How could they not? But to be carefree, they must pretend not to care in their disconnect between song and text. They continue their faintly catchy melodies, cheerless recitative, predictable cadences, all the while deceiving themselves.
We too enjoy. The cast is wonderful, revealing as many accents and vocal types as it does bodies and beings. Besides the touring singers, members of the outstanding L.A. vocal group Tonality participate, adding a welcome local zing. Each vocal presence I found a pleasure to hear.
There's that word, again. Pleasure. The extraordinariness of "Sun & Sea" is not its comment on these pedestrian beachgoers, who lounge and do nothing, but its statement about all of us and, maybe, the lucky few who get to see this amazing work, smug in our success in snagging tickets. We take our pleasure being amused and sanctimoniously scandalized, clucking about the need to be better while not being any better.
I burned a couple of carbon-spewing gallons of gasoline driving solo in traffic to and from the Geffen Contemporary while listening to news about the awful oil spill off Huntington Beach and the awful Alisal fire.
"Sun & Sea" is as devastating as it must be.

Diane Weyermann, a longtime pillar of the documentary community who helped shepherd such Oscar-winning documentaries as "An Inconvenient Truth," "Citizenfour" and "American Factory" as an executive at Participant, has died at age 66.
Participant, where Weyermann served as chief content officer, announced that she died in New York on Thursday of cancer.
Weyermann joined Participant in 2005 and was the driving force behind the company's issues-oriented, consciousness-raising documentary film and television slate, steering the production of such films as "Darfur Now," "Food, Inc." "Waiting for Superman" and "John Lewis: Good Trouble."
Under Weyermann's leadership, Participant projects on issues including climate change, government surveillance, the plight of refugees and the nation's broken educational system earned 10 Oscar nominations and four wins, as well as eight Emmy nominations and three wins.
"In the very earliest days of Participant, I was incredibly lucky to have Diane agree to run our newfound documentary department, including our first documentary, 'An Inconvenient Truth,' " Participant founder Jeff Skoll said in a statement.
"From day 1, Diane brought a passion to her work and cared deeply about the battles we helped fight over the issues portrayed in each film. Over 17 years together, she was a champion in every way, through strategic, industry, and emerging global challenges. Diane was the heart and soul of Participant."
Before joining the fledgling Participant, Weyermann served as director of the Sundance Institute's Documentary Film Program, where she oversaw the Sundance Documentary Fund and launched two annual documentary film labs, the Edit & Story Lab and the Documentary Composers Lab, which she co-created with Peter Golub.
Before her work at the Sundance Institute, Weyermann served as director of George Soros' Open Society Institute, where she launched the Soros Documentary Fund, aimed at supporting documentaries focused on human rights issues, which later became the Sundance Documentary Fund.
"It is not hyperbole to say that Diane Weyermann changed the world for the better in a remarkable way," former Vice President Al Gore, who worked with Weyermann on both 2006's climate-change documentary "An Inconvenient Truth" and its 2017 follow-up, "An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power," said in a statement.
"She shone a powerful spotlight on stories that provoked thoughtful action to promote justice and ignited progress toward a better, safer and more equitable future. With her skill and passion, she spurred millions to become changemakers."
Weyermann also served on the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' foreign language film award and international feature film award executive committees from 2016 to 2020 and co-chaired the committees from 2018 to 2020.
Born and raised in St. Louis, Weyermann attended George Washington University and studied law at St. Louis University. Starting her career in legal aid, she soon saw the potential to elevate issues affecting her economically disadvantaged and marginalized clients through storytelling, going on to receive her MFA at Columbia College's film school in Chicago.
"As the steward of Participant films for the past 17 years, she showed how fierce determination to authentic storytelling can drive civic participation and create a more empathetic world," Participant Chief Executive David Linde said in a statement. "There was no story worth telling that Diane shied away from."
Weyermann is survived by her sister Andrea, her brother-in-law Tim and three nephews.

Hope isn't a climate-change option -- but activism is

I was in high school when the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its finalized "Fifth Assessment Report." For a week in 2014, the report occupied my computer screen, side by side with an unfinished college application essay.
IPCC reports are the most comprehensive accounts of how human activities influence the climate. In the seven years since the IPCC released its fifth report, I completed a bachelor's degree, spent a year in the workforce, completed a master's degree and began a career in energy policy. Over the same time, humanity emitted about 220 billion tons of CO2, more than the total emitted from the beginning of the Industrial Age to the end of World War II. So as the release of the IPCC's sixth assessment approached this year, I found myself dreading what it would reveal.
On Aug. 9, I found out. The latest report represented "a code red for humanity," the U.N. secretary-general said. All my fears, confirmed.
But the horror I anticipated never arrived. I combed through page after page of catastrophic projections with the same level of alarm I'd have reading a recipe for peach cobbler. At the end of the document, I closed the tab and opened an article about the Tokyo Olympics. Ashamed as I am to admit it, I felt nothing.
At the age of 25, I am of a generation of people who have been aware -- terrifyingly, paralyzingly aware -- of climate change for our entire lives. From the moment I began to take an interest in world affairs, I have been cognizant of a terrible danger beyond the horizon, a near insurmountable challenge that could throw the world I knew into chaos. In sixth grade, a close friend confessed to me that he had been losing sleep worrying about climate change. I told him I had too.
For me, and I suspect for my friend, the climate crisis has never been about hope. In my quarter-century on Earth, no great challenge -- be it terrorism, disease or economic catastrophe -- has gone unmet by division, bigotry and greed; why should climate change be any different? With each passing year, I have seen the window of opportunity to act grow ever narrower, all the while becoming more confident in my hopelessness.
But neither has the climate crisis evoked the fatalism that often accompanies hopelessness. Not once in my lifetime has the apparent inevitability of climate catastrophe overwhelmed my motivation to act on it. In my head, I am forever on a sinking ship, faced with the choice of passively drowning or swimming doggedly for shore. And so I swim, understanding I will probably drown, but certain that doing something is better than doing nothing.
Many in my generation approach the climate crisis through this confusing cocktail of pessimism and determination. With no hope of avoiding catastrophe, we nevertheless campaign tirelessly for this impossibility. We have seen no evidence that society will solve this problem, yet we act each day as if it might.
This is why I felt nothing reading the latest IPCC report. It held within its pages a simple confirmation of what my generation had already observed: a detailed catalog of repeated, inexcusable failures to deal with an ever-apparent crisis.
The report belatedly acknowledges an off-ramp. There is still, it reminds us, the possibility of limiting global warming to 1.5?C. Should humanity collectively commit to solving the problem, there remains a tiny chance of avoiding catastrophe.
Popular discourse parrots this approach. Politicians fighting for climate action obligatorily reframe the crisis as an opportunity. Reporters interviewing experts end each segment with the question, "What gives you hope?" (I am guilty of this.) Through it all, we are told a singular message: The only way to overcome the challenge of climate change is to hold out hope that we will do so.
This message is simplistic at best, condescending at worst. Younger generations consistently report pessimism and depression over the impending climate crisis. These same generations are leading the global wave of activism and electoral support for climate action. Through it all we have proved capable of holding two conflicting ideas in mind at once. On the one hand, we acknowledge the near inevitability of catastrophic climate change. On the other, we understand we must fight against it because, after all, what other option do we have?
Beyond hope there is more than despair. There is determination, realism and action. There is a generation raised amid the ravages of a changing climate making every effort -- a constant effort -- to prevent the inevitable. The ship may sink, but we are going to swim like hell toward shore.

When scientists and activists make the case for phasing out fossil fuels, they often focus on the climate crisis: Stop burning coal, oil and natural gas, and we can prevent wildfires, droughts, heat waves and storms from continuing to get worse.
But the catastrophic oil spill in Southern California over the weekend offered a stark reminder that the damage to human health and the natural world from powering society with fossil fuels is far greater than just a warming planet.
Experts pointed to the leaking oil pipeline off the Orange County coast as just one example of the nonstop harm caused by drilling, production and combustion. Even without the climate crisis, there are many reasons to refashion the global economy around solar and wind energy, they said.
Those reasons include astonishingly deadly air pollution, contamination of water supplies, destruction of wildlife habitat and the never-ending barrage of leaks, spills and blowouts that can kill people and animals and stain beloved landscapes.
"From a societal point of view, it only makes sense because the oil companies and gas companies and coal companies don't actually pay all of these bills. They just pass them on," said Drew Shindell, a climate scientist at Duke University. "For society as a whole to support the use of fossil fuels, it just doesn't make sense, especially when we have alternatives now."
Shindell's latest research focuses not on carbon dioxide emissions that trap heat in the atmosphere, but rather ozone and fine-particle pollution that damages the human body. He offered a preview of the soon-to-be-published findings in congressional testimony last year, telling lawmakers that keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius, (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) -- the goal agreed upon by every nation on Earth -- would prevent 4.5 million premature deaths and millions more hospitalizations and emergency room visits in the United States alone over the next 50 years.
The economic benefits -- in terms of lives saved, hospital visits avoided and workdays not lost due to illness or deaths -- would exceed $700 billion per year, higher than published estimates of the costs of weaning the economy off fossil fuels.
Shindell's air pollution estimates only cover health conditions such as heart and lung disease for which there's a long enough track record of scientific data to run the numbers with confidence. Newer strains of research -- such as studies linking fossil fuel pollution to preterm births and cognitive declines in children -- would make the picture even worse.
"With or without climate change, the benefits of getting rid of fossil fuels outweigh the costs," Shindell said.
Those health costs stem from the everyday production and burning of coal, oil and gas. But the consequences only grow during a moment of chaos such as the Orange County pipeline rupture, which dumped an estimated 144,000 gallons of crude into the Pacific.
It's yet to be seen how many fish, birds and other animals will die from oil exposure. But these types of events have a poor track record. British oil giant BP paid a $100-million fine after the much larger Deepwater Horizon blowout in the Gulf of Mexico killed an estimated 1 million birds, a disaster that may also have resulted in nearly $1 billion in losses for the seafood industry.
What's more, oil spills are distressingly common, with thousands occurring in the United States each year. One infamous spill off the Louisiana coast has been going strong since 2004. Just last month Southern California Gas Co., the nation's largest gas utility, agreed to a $1.8-billion settlement after its Aliso Canyon storage field leaked for nearly four months, sickening local residents.
Jackie Savitz, chief policy officer for North America at the environmental group Oceana, described offshore drilling in particular as "dirty and dangerous from the time it starts, even from the exploration phase," when seismic blasting can disturb marine life.
She said it's vital for Congress to approve the $3.5-trillion "Build Back Better" plan being pushed by President Biden and Democratic lawmakers. The legislation would ban new offshore oil and gas leases in the Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean and the eastern Gulf of Mexico, among many provisions designed to increase clean energy and phase out fossil fuels.
It's not clear what Congress will do. Two Senate Democrats, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, have said they're not comfortable with the price tag. Without their votes, and with no Republican support, the bill won't pass.
"Unfortunately the [fossil fuel] industry has these champions that won't hear of it," Savitz said. "That's what's keeping us in this dangerous business that's literally creating existential problems for our country, and for our planet."
In the meantime, the Biden administration just scheduled a huge oil and gas lease sale in the Gulf of Mexico. A judge ordered the sale after the president attempted to pause new leases, but Savitz said the president's appointees are going too far.
"They're selling off all the rest of the leases in the Gulf of Mexico that they could legally sell," she said.
The fossil fuel industry and its supporters argue that American society couldn't function without coal, oil and gas. Solar and wind power, they say, aren't capable of keeping the lights on 24 hours a day, at least not without batteries and other energy storage technologies that aren't ready for prime time. They also say that moving too quickly to renewables would raise energy costs.
But a growing number of scientists have found otherwise.
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory, for instance, says Los Angeles can achieve 98% clean electricity by 2030 without increasing the risk of blackouts or disrupting the local economy. University of Oxford researchers published a working paper last month estimating that a rapid transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy could save $26 trillion in energy costs globally.
Renewable power plants can cause environmental problems, too. In California, solar farms have destroyed habitat used by desert tortoises and other at-risk species. Wind turbines kill birds, as former President Trump liked to point out. Lithium, a metal used in electric vehicle batteries and solar power storage, is mostly produced via environmentally destructive processes.
Still, there's no comparison between those problems and the destruction wrought by fossil fuels, said Dustin Mulvaney, an environmental studies professor at San Jose State. Much of his research deals with the challenges posed by clean energy development, including solar panel supply chains and land-use conflicts. But the Huntington Beach oil spill, Mulvaney noted, is the type of "catastrophic accident" that you'd never see at a solar or wind farm.
"There's just no mess that could be made so big," he said.
Especially in the Western United States, habitat fragmentation is one of the most significant negative consequences of energy production -- both renewable and fossil. The region has vast stretches of relatively undisturbed landscapes, where solar and wind farms are now adding to the pressures posed by mining, grazing and oil and gas extraction.
A 2016 study from scientists at the Nature Conservancy compared the land area consumed by different types of energy. Although wind and solar farms take up more space on the landscape than oil or gas extraction per unit of energy produced, they found, fossil fuel companies need to keep finding new land to drill -- unlike renewable energy developers, who can build a facility in one spot and then let it hum away for decades. That led the scientists to conclude that the land-use effects are comparable.
"There are always trade-offs," said Nels Johnson, the Nature Conservancy's North America energy program director. "But with renewable energy you have more flexibility in terms of where you put stuff. Wherever the wind blows or the sun is shining is a potential place for developing wind or solar energy," meaning unlike with fossil fuels -- which need to be extracted wherever they happen to be found -- sensitive locations can be avoided with smart planning.
And as for birds and wind turbines? The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimates the death toll at half a million per year at most, which the National Audubon Society points out is "significantly less than deaths caused by outdoor cats and building collisions."
Audubon says it's important to do everything possible to minimize the threat posed by wind farms. But Garry George, who leads Audubon's clean energy initiative, said the Orange County oil spill is a sad reminder that fossil fuels are a far worse threat.
"I've never heard of a wind turbine spill," he said. "That's just another reason why we need clean energy as soon as possible."
Yet another reason, of course, is climate change. For humans, and also for birds. Audubon estimates that in North America alone, 389 bird species could go extinct if humanity doesn't get its act together -- including dozens found in Orange County.

Fan of national parks? Get ready for them to heat up; Climate change will make it less pleasant to visit public lands in summer, a study finds.

Glaciers vanishing in Glacier National Park. Sand dunes blowing away at White Sands in New Mexico. Wildfire smoke obscuring the Tetons, flames licking at the sequoias near their namesake park and Joshua trees dying out in theirs.
These are just some of the ways that global heating is reshaping America's public lands.
If you care about endangered species, it's not great. If you think we should preserve ecosystems that support human health, it's no better. And if you enjoy hiking in wildlands during the summer, you might want to prepare yourself.
A new study from Utah State University's Institute of Outdoor Recreation and Tourism, published this month, tries to quantify how our enjoyment of public lands will shift as temperatures rise.
The researchers estimate that outdoor recreation in the summer could drop 18% by 2050, with public lands visitation rising by 12% in the winter. The summer drop-off could be greatest in the already hot and muggy South Atlantic-Gulf region, with California and other Western states seeing substantial declines, too.
"I think climate change is going to impact pretty much everything we do in our daily lives moving forward," said lead author Emily Wilkins, who conducted the research as a postdoc at Utah State.
The study is significant for several reasons.
First off, Wilkins and her colleagues came up with a fascinating method for measuring public lands visitation, and used those measurements to make projections going forward. The National Park Service is the only federal lands agency that collects visitor data by month or season, so the researchers turned to social media. They downloaded millions of geotagged photos from the image-hosting website Flickr, spanning 2006-2019 and taken on public lands managed by dozens of federal and state agencies.
Then they calculated average season-by-season maximum temperatures for the areas where those photos were taken; ran models to estimate how heat affected visitation within different parts of the country (accounting for various other factors); and finally used existing projections of rising temperatures to estimate how visitation patterns will change as the climate crisis worsens.
Why use Flickr for geotagged photos, rather than far more popular Instagram?
It turns out Flickr, unlike Instagram, makes its data available to the public for free. And although Flickr may not be the cat's meow in 2021, Wilkins says it was plenty popular for much of the last 15 years, giving her and her colleagues sufficient data.
And what about all the second-order climate consequences that might affect how and when people visit public lands, beyond just extreme heat -- stuff like wildfire smoke, evaporating reservoirs and worsening storms?
Wilkins agreed that researchers have many more questions to address. She pointed to hunting and fishing as popular pastimes that could be disrupted as animals seek out new habitats better suited to their needs and as earlier-melting mountain snow changes the timing of peak fishing season. The timing of popular wildflower blooms could also change.
"It's easier to study temperature and precipitation and big broad climate patterns across the U.S. But it's harder to understand how indirect factors like changing species distribution are going to impact where people go, how they experience the outdoors," Wilkins said. "There's a big question of how these little, more indirect effects of climate change are going to add up."
The study identified the Upper Colorado River Basin as the only region projected to see fewer winter visitors as the planet warms, which Wilkins said is likely because skiing in the Rocky Mountains is a main draw.
For hikers or trail runners who don't depend on snow or the presence of certain animals to have a good time, rising temperatures "will impact them a little bit less," Wilkins said. "You don't have to plan around when the fish are going to be in the stream."
That may be comforting for people who mainly enjoy public lands through hiking. But for the government officials charged with managing those lands, there's a lot more to worry about -- and that's where the new research could offer guidance.
If visitation falls in summer but grows in winter (and potentially spring as well), agencies such as the National Park Service and the Bureau of Land Management may need to keep visitors centers, bathrooms and campgrounds open throughout the year, rather than just seasonally, or even hire more staffers in the winter. That will almost certainly require additional funding.
Gateway towns just outside national parks and monuments -- such as Moab, Utah, or Estes Park, Colo. -- may also have to adjust. Restaurants, gear merchants and other businesses catering to tourists might need to stay open more of the year.
Still, even if fewer people camp in Great Basin National Park or Bears Ears National Monument over the summer than might have otherwise, that doesn't mean summer visitor counts will necessarily drop. National parks and other public lands are more popular than ever. Wilkins wouldn't be surprised if overall summer visitation continues to rise.
And that's where there might be a silver lining in the new study. The most popular parks are already dealing with severe overcrowding, a problem that is typically worse during summer season. Packed crowds can diminish the experience of quiet and solitude that many people seek out in nature and make life unpleasant even in the most tourism-friendly gateway towns.
Shifting some of those crowds to winter and spring could be a breath of fresh air for park managers and nearby residents.
"Certain places might want more visitation, and certain places might be overcrowded and not want more visitation," Wilkins said.
What about Death Valley National Park, already one of the hottest places on Earth? Not many people brave the intense summer heat to begin with, and last year's 130-degree temperatures sent tourists scrambling to take photos with the giant thermometer at Furnace Creek. Maybe additional heat records would be a boon for the park?
Wilkins didn't have much to say about that. She did, however, suggest public lands managers will need to do more to keep summer visitors informed about dealing with extreme heat: how much water to carry, how to stay safe. Just last month, two hikers died at Death Valley within a few days of each other.
And lest we forget, the future isn't set in stone. Some amount of climate change is already baked in, but the more humanity can reduce emissions, the less global temperatures will rise. Ultimately, the fate of our public lands is in our hands.

Joshua trees, the tall, twisty succulents that mark the Mojave Desert, are survivors.
Unlike coast redwoods or giant sequoias, they largely escaped harvesting and habitat losses when Europeans colonized their home. They flourished, in fact, until the last decades of the 20th century brought sprawling development and a changing climate.
Three weeks ago, a federal court ruled that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service underestimated these threats in a 2019 assessment and must reconsider Joshua trees for protection under the Endangered Species Act. That protection would be a first step toward securing the trees' future, but only a first step.
Today, Joshua trees are ensnared in a tangle of interlocking threats. Models of future climates show that 90% or more of the trees' current habitat will be unsuitable by the end of this century. In the hotter, drier parts of the Mojave, seedling Joshua trees are already a rare sight. More mobile animal and plant species have already begun to shift to cooler and wetter portions of their ranges, but not only are Joshua trees rooted in the ground, their seeds are inefficiently dispersed by desert rodents. Given that the trees take decades to grow to reproductive age, and their capacity for movement is at most a few hundred yards a generation, they cannot hope to outpace climate change.
There are Joshua tree stands where climates could stay suitable even 80 years from now -- "climate refugia," they're called. Unfortunately, not all refugia are on protected lands, and even a climate refuge inside a national park is not secure against the increasing frequency of wildfire across the Mojave. The cooler conditions that define refugia are also more suitable for certain grasses, which create a carpet of vegetation to fuel fires, and droughts supercharged by climate change ensure that this vegetation carpet is tinder-dry.
There are refugia in the higher elevations of Joshua Tree National Park, but up to half of them have burned in recent decades. Another likely refuge was decimated by last year's Cima Dome fire in the Mojave National Preserve, which incinerated as many as a million Joshua trees. Restoring populations after these losses will take decades.
Joshua trees are also threatened by expanding urban areas -- the Antelope Valley cities of Lancaster, Palmdale and Victorville have quintupled in population since 1980 -- and by the development that comes with mining and with wind and solar power generation.
The Bureau of Land Management is considering a proposal for mining exploration near Conglomerate Mesa, a possible climate refuge with extensive Joshua tree woodlands. The Mojave is also slated for intensive solar energy development to address the wider threat of climate change. The federal government's Desert Renewable Energy and Conservation Plan designated 600 square miles of the Mojave for energy development, and by one estimate, the state of California would need to fill most of that space with solar farms to achieve its planned carbon emission reductions.
Many of these farms can be built without compromising pristine Joshua tree habitat, but there is no doubt that the scale of development needed to bring climate change under control will be enormous. Ironically, building the renewable energy capacity we desperately need to avert more severe climate change may be, in some cases, in direct conflict with Joshua trees' capacity to survive climate change.
With climate catastrophe now a fact of daily life, we must act urgently to find and protect the Joshua tree populations best equipped to survive. Fighting to save every last Joshua tree will not only be futile; it also risks wasting time, resources, invaluable social capital and political goodwill.
Our best hope is to focus on protecting places where Joshua trees still have a fighting chance -- but we do not yet have the data we need to identify those places with confidence.
To decide which Joshua trees need focused protections, we must dramatically improve our collection of on-the-ground information about the health of Joshua tree populations across the Mojave: which ones are successfully growing new seedlings and which are faltering. We also need genetic data of a quality that has rarely been gathered in other threatened species, to pinpoint gene variants that allow Joshua trees to weather the harshest conditions. Populations that already harbor those variants may become high priority for protection.
We could also replant burned areas in climate refugia with seeds genetically calibrated to survive warmer, drier conditions, or even supplement failing populations with seeds transplanted from their more robust kin.
The people who live in and enjoy the wild landscapes of the Mojave must be partners in this effort, from data collection to decision-making. The tribal, state and local governments that oversee much of the private land in the region must be included in the development of any plans to steward its most distinctive tree, and those plans will be far more successful with the input and support of the people who call the desert home.
None of this will be easy. It would be far simpler to declare every tree sacred and be done. That approach, however, would fail to harness the resilience that lies within Joshua tree populations -- and it could jeopardize the broader fight against climate change. Joshua trees are a case study in the tangle of trade-offs we must make to protect biodiversity on a warming planet. With care and perspective, they could become a model for how we solve these dilemmas.

Second Opinion :: BIG IDEAS ON GLOBAL CHALLENGES; The military can lead in the fight against climate change; The Defense Department has the expertise. Now it must give the order.

Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III declared global warming an existential threat to U.S. national security at a White House climate summit earlier this year. Using language normally applied to conventional adversaries like China and Russia, Austin described the climate crisis as "a profoundly destabilizing force for our world," generating widespread havoc and bloodshed.
If we take his assessment at his word, the Department of Defense will have to mobilize its capabilities as if preparing for a major war -- altering its priorities and operations and hardening its military bases against extreme climate effects.
This will prove no easy task. The Pentagon is the nation's leading institutional consumer of fossil fuels and the single largest institutional producer of greenhouse gases in the world. In 2020, for example, the U.S. armed forces were responsible for approximately 52 million metric tons in carbon dioxide emissions -- more than was emitted by some entire countries, such as Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.
Clearly, the U.S. cannot reduce its national greenhouse gas emissions rapidly without a sustained drive by the Pentagon to abandon carbon-based fuels in favor of renewable energy. Of course, the technologies it must develop to achieve such advances would have widespread application to the civilian economy as well.
The benefits to America's future -- and the world's -- would be broad. But it all depends on whether the Pentagon leadership is serious about treating climate change as an existential threat and acting accordingly.
Only in recent years has the military begun to consider climate change in its operations -- focusing on how this crisis affects its bases, since some of its major coastal installations are under threat from rising seas, severe storms and persistent flooding.
In recognition of these perils, the Defense Department finally identified global warming as a national security concern in 2010. Climate change, its Quadrennial Defense Review stated, "could have significant geopolitical impacts around the world," while also jeopardizing the utility of key bases at home.
That year, for the first time, the department adopted specific objectives for wide reductions in fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions. Under its Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan for 2010, the department pledged to reduce petroleum use by its nontactical vehicle fleets by 30% by 2020 relative to 2005. The plan also included the objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions at U.S. military installations and their energy suppliers by 34% relative to 2008.
Over the next 10 years, the department made impressive efforts to fulfill these objectives, replacing 44% of its petroleum-fueled vehicles with hybrids and all-electric cars and building massive solar arrays to generate electricity for its bases.
In 2020, the Pentagon stated it reduced petroleum use by 41% relative to 2005 and cut greenhouse gas emissions by 23% relative to 2008.
But, crucially, these targets did not apply to ships, aircraft and combat vehicles -- almost all of which continue to be powered by petroleum and remain a major source of greenhouse gases. Jet fuel for military planes is a huge emitter. A B-2 bomber, for example, uses 4.2 gallons of fuel to travel just one nautical mile; a single air mission puts hundreds of tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
During Donald Trump's presidency, talk of climate change largely disappeared from official Pentagon statements and the sense of urgency in resisting it seemed to dissipate as senior officers began to emphasize the growing threats from China and Russia. Now, with Joe Biden in the White House and Austin at the Pentagon, climate change has again been identified as a major security threat, one that requires a full-scale response.
However, the Pentagon has yet to outline specific actions or objectives that would include far greater reductions in fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions than its 2010 sustainability plan included. If climate change poses an "existential" threat, it is imperative that these goals be extended to tactical as well as nontactical military vehicles. Additionally, all U.S. military installations should be required to obtain all of their primary energy from renewable sources by 2035.
Mobilization on this scale would require a major allocation of Defense funds and resources. This is not beyond the Pentagon's capabilities, given that it was able to reduce its petroleum consumption and greenhouse gas emissions between 2010 and 2020.
With access to the world's largest research budget, the department and its top scientists have the capacity to create the technologies needed to achieve major breakthroughs in green energy and transportation -- technologies that could be adopted broadly.
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, known as DARPA, could take the lead. The agency has helped develop advancements such as GPS, the internet and artificial intelligence. It recently began a program called Reefense to use reefs, natural features and engineered structures to protect 1,700 department-managed military facilities that are threatened by sea level rise and coastal flooding from storms and wave action.
The Defense Department now needs to go beyond preparing for the consequences of climate change to being a leader in developing broad-based technologies to reduce global warming. It has the financial resources and scientific expertise to take on this challenge. Now the order must be given.

Patti Poppe has a tough job.
In the nine months since she took the helm of Pacific Gas & Electric, the nation's largest and possibly most hated utility, Poppe has seen the company potentially implicated in the 963,000-acre Dixie fire and brought up on criminal charges stemming from two other blazes. This for a company that last year pleaded guilty to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter after sparking the fire that destroyed the town of Paradise in November 2018, and a few months later exited bankruptcy after facing tens of billions of dollars in wildfire liabilities.
When The Times spoke with Poppe on Wednesday, a PG&E spokesperson said the veteran utility executive would begin the conversation with prepared remarks. Poppe insisted PG&E is finally making real progress on reducing the risk of ignitions. She said the company is taking "breakthrough actions" such as trimming and removing more trees in risky areas, adding weather stations and high-definition cameras to help identify threats in real time, and beginning to bury some electric lines underground.
"Every day, our system is safer than it was the day before," she said.
Poppe also said PG&E has implemented new safety settings that have reduced ignitions by 90% since late July, compared with previous years, and is using technology to limit the scope and duration of intentional power shut-offs designed to prevent infernos.
"We'll continue working every day to battle the enemy we all face, which is the changing climate around us," she said.
After Poppe's remarks, it was time to ask questions -- about climate, the energy transition and whether wildfire victims will ever be made whole. The following highlights from the conversation have been edited and condensed for clarity.
--
L.A. TIMES: Let's start with clean energy, since so much of what California is doing to reduce carbon emissions and fight climate change depends on the electric grid. What new steps do you think are needed for the state to meet its goals, and how do we meet those goals while keeping the lights on during peak fire season?
POPPE: I actually find it quite inspiring. For example, when I think about the need for backup power resources when we take the necessary action of a Public Safety Power Shutoff, I imagine a day where electric vehicles are powering the home. So we've done two things: We've provided resilience, and we've decarbonized the transportation that is mobilizing that family. We can clean the air, help the war on climate change, and help people adapt to the changing climate of wildfire.
I imagine a future where maybe it's not wireless power, but it is a whole lot less wires, particularly in our most fire-prone areas.
--
LAT: In addition to electric cars, there's building electrification -- switching from space heaters and stoves that burn natural gas to ones that run on clean electricity. PG&E has supported policies that promote construction of all-electric homes. How much of the company's business do you see shifting from gas to electricity, and how quickly?
POPPE: It's a great question, and we still have a lot of work to do to answer it. I believe there are important targeted electrification efforts that we should make, and we will do that systematically. When we're making an investment decision in our gas business, we should be asking ourselves, "Is this the time to convert this service to electric?" We're studying it pretty deeply.
--
LAT: Critics of those efforts say it's a terrible idea to make ourselves more dependent on the electric grid when wildfires and heat waves are already making it harder just to keep the lights on. What's your response to that?
POPPE: I would love to flip that on its head for just a minute. This is a surprising statistic: The electric vehicles on the road in PG&E's service area today have 6,700 megawatts of capacity. Now, they do need to be charged with electricity. But imagine a Flex Alert being averted because we actually leverage the supply that's available in vehicles to power homes and businesses.
Sixty-seven hundred megawatts -- that's three Diablo Canyon nuclear power plants. It's on the road today, and we are not using it as a power source. We're only using it as a power draw.
Storage is the key to unlocking the potential of renewable energy, which we all understand is not available 24/7. But using the excess renewable energy that we have on a daily basis to fuel our vehicles, and then allowing our vehicles to fuel our homes -- it's a totally different game.
--
LAT: On that note, let's talk about putting more power "where the people are." There are a lot of folks furious with PG&E, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric for pushing Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration to slash net metering, the main program that incentivizes rooftop solar and storage installations. Why are you doing that?
POPPE: We believe, and I think the Legislature believes, that there was a time when cost incentives were necessary to enable technology to evolve. So in the early days of rooftop solar, net metering was an important enabler. But now the cost reductions have come. There are economic ways to deploy solar, and I think there's a way for utilities and independent solar and battery providers to work together to optimize the system, and no longer have winners and losers. Let's make it accessible to all.
--
LAT: Shifting gears to wildfires, you said PG&E is trying to cut off electricity to fewer people during high-risk conditions, and keep those interruptions shorter. On Oct. 11, you shut off power to 25,000 homes and businesses, and another 660 customers lost electricity Thursday. Would these events have been worse in the past?
POPPE: There's no doubt. Looking back historically at similar conditions, hundreds of thousands of customers would have been impacted.
We are narrowing that down through our sectionalizing devices in particular. We've installed 1,136 devices that break the grid down into smaller sections. And that enables us to have fewer people impacted.
We've also developed a sophisticated algorithm that helps us pinpoint high-risk areas. If we'd had it in place in previous years, we would have prevented 96% of the structures that were damaged or lost due to utility-caused wildfires. And we can do that while fewer people are being impacted by shut-offs.
--
LAT: There's a fire burning right now in Santa Barbara County, the Alisal fire. It's scorched thousands of acres since it ignited last week and forced hundreds of homes to evacuate. Are there any indications that PG&E's infrastructure could be involved?
POPPE: It is early to know, but we don't have equipment that was near the ignition point. But obviously there's nothing definitive yet.
--
LAT: You recently set a goal of burying 10,000 miles of electric lines, at an estimated price tag of $15 billion to $30 billion. That's after years and years of California utilities suggesting undergrounding was too expensive to work at scale. When can we expect to see more details on which lines will be buried and how much it will actually cost?
POPPE: We are making great progress. We did a national request for information from big construction companies, contractors, other utilities, just getting the best information. We are reviewing the responses. There are some great ideas and technologies that we have not been deploying that we will be able to.
We also formed a voluntary undergrounding council of community leaders, environmental groups, tribal leaders, Caltrans, California Professional Firefighters. So many people want to help enable undergrounding. And we can't actually do this by ourselves. It's a huge infrastructure project, probably one of the largest infrastructure reimaginations that has occurred in our state's history. We need partners.
I also think people don't understand that only about 10% of wildfire ignitions are caused by utility equipment. And we're going to end that. We are going to fix our stuff. Everyone can rest assured about that. But there's 90% of the problem left after that. And so there's a bigger conversation. We need to make California safe and resilient to these climate conditions.
--
LAT: We should also talk about a recent investigation that was published by KQED and the California Newsroom, reported by Lily Jamali. They found that Wall Street hedge funds are selling off PG&E stock en masse, driving down the share price. The result is that wildfire victims, still waiting for payouts, are left holding the bag. The PG&E stock they received as part of the bankruptcy exit plan was supposed to be worth $6.75 billion, but now it's worth only $4.5 billion.
This arrangement was made before you arrived. But how was this allowed to happen? Is it PG&E's fault if fire victims are never made whole?
POPPE: One of the key things that I am committed to is making it right and making it safe. And part of making it right is making it right for victims. And this agreement that was struck has the potential to be very rewarding for victims.
But one of the things that's hard for people to understand is: We have to compete to attract capital. Our stock price is driven by investors' willingness to put their money into a California utility.
So I think that it is both on PG&E to prove ourselves to be strong operators, and on California to prove to investors that we are a great place to invest their dollars. And when they see that the investor-owned utility model has the support of regulators and legislators, then they feel more confident putting their clients' dollars into PG&E stock.
Currently, PG&E's stock trades at a significant discount relative to our peers in this sector, and that is because people are afraid to invest in utilities in California. We need to change that narrative.
--
LAT: So in terms of the payout that was promised to fire victims -- you're saying their being made whole depends on PG&E succeeding as a company, and on California showing support for PG&E to help get the stock price up?
POPPE: Yes. And we've got a lot of room to get the stock price up.
People can argue about the arrangement, and you're right, I wasn't here when it was made. But given what the arrangement is, we have a mutual interest with wildfire victims in PG&E being a successful investor-owned utility. We need the capital markets so that we can fund the infrastructure rebuild, and so we can participate in the decarbonization of our economy.
There's a real win-win opportunity.

California sees its hottest summer ever -- so far; Climate change is causing heat records in the Golden State and across the West to be 'broken in quick succession,' expert says

California and several other western states this year endured the hottest summer on record, according to federal data released Thursday, underscoring the ways rapid climate change is unleashing unprecedented wildfires, deadly heat waves and drought conditions.
In addition to California, officials said Idaho, Nevada, Oregon and Utah also set all-time heat records for the meteorological summer, spanning June through August. Sixteen other states also saw a top-five warmest summer on record, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which issued its findings Thursday.
Nationwide, the stretch from June to August tied with the 1936 Dust Bowl summer as the hottest on record, with temperatures across the country averaging 2.6 degrees above average.
Rising temperatures have been a common denominator in a summer of ecological crises across the West.
A heat wave that blanketed the Pacific Northwest in June claimed the lives of hundreds, including immigrant farmworkers and the elderly. An estimated 1 billion sea creatures died because of heat off the coast, and the Sacramento River is facing a "near-complete loss" of young Chinook salmon because of abnormally warm waters.
The searing heat dried the state's landscape and helped pave the way for more than 2 million acres to burn, with officials fearing the worst is yet to come. The blazes sent scores of residents fleeing from their homes and choked countless others with lung-burning smoke.
Just this week, Lancaster saw its 58th day of the year with temperatures above 100 degrees -- breaking a record from 2003. Fresno broke its record with 64 triple-digit days. On Wednesday, record temperatures for Sept. 8 were registered in Palmdale, Sandberg and Paso Robles, where highs reached 106, 95 and 106 degrees, respectively, the National Weather Service said.
"All these records are being broken, and broken in quick succession," said Karen McKinnon, an assistant professor at the UCLA Institute of the Environment and Sustainability, "and that's basically indicative of this trend that is largely due to climate change."
The grim conditions of the Dust Bowl years were more of an outlier, McKinnon said, while the latest extremes belong to a larger warming trend. In fact, she said, the summer of 2021 was even hotter than mere extrapolation would suggest, leading some to question whether that warming is accelerating.
Alan Barreca, an environmental economist at UCLA, said the record summer months were not surprising given the "fairly steady increase in temperatures in California and throughout the world" -- but they are concerning.
Extreme heat is among the deadliest of natural disasters, he said, and soaring temperatures often disproportionately affect the most vulnerable, including pregnant women, infants, elderly people, homeless people and residents of low-income neighborhoods.
Extreme heat is also worrisome because it expands the necessity for and reliance on air conditioning -- which not only furthers inequality but also feeds into the climate-change system that is driving temperatures up.
"Air conditioners seem to be an absolute necessity going into the end of the 21st century," Barreca said. "We're going to need them, and we're going to also need to be cutting back on our emissions."
Conditions have already become so dire that the California Independent System Operator, which runs most of the state's power grid, on Tuesday asked the federal government to declare an "electric reliability emergency" that would allow six natural gas-fired power plants -- including facilities in Huntington Beach and Long Beach -- to generate power at maximum levels, even if they violate air pollution limits.
It's a scrambling effort by state officials to reduce the risk of rolling blackouts in the face of increased energy demands by adding new electricity supplies, including fossil-fuel resources that contribute to climate change and worsening heat waves -- a short-term sacrifice that has proved controversial among clean energy groups.
The grid operator was granted a similar request during a heat wave last September, but only for a week. This time, the agency is asking for 60 days -- a sign that it expects extreme heat could continue well into the fall. The ISO has already issued two flex alerts this week, which call on residents to conserve energy from 4 to 9 p.m., when net demand is typically at its peak.
But even as the energy grid groans, heat advisories and storm-system warnings are promising to bring more dangers to residents in the form of increased fire weather. More than a dozen active wildfires are burning across California, and officials fear that added heat, dryness and the potential for dry lightning could make conflagrations worse or even ignite new ones.
The National Weather Service is forecasting very hot and dry conditions in Southern California through Friday, with temperatures in some areas expected to be 5 to 15 degrees warmer than normal. The Antelope Valley area could see daytime temperatures as high as 108 degrees, while Los Angeles will climb into the 90s Friday and Saturday.
A heat advisory also has been issued across the Inland Empire, the Santa Ana Mountains and portions of San Bernardino and Riverside counties through Friday. Residents are advised to seek shade, stay hydrated and avoid any activity that could spark a fire.
In several areas across the state, the possibility of thunderstorms could bring erratic winds, flash flooding and the "potential for lightning-caused wildfires," officials said.
"It's all a concern," said David Sweet, a meteorologist with the weather service in Oxnard. "If a lightning strike starts a fire, then the gusty winds could push it quickly. And aside from thunderstorm activities, it's going to be pretty warm and dry. ... So with the heat, with any gusty winds -- elevated fire danger."
But the maximum threat remains in Northern California, where beleaguered fire crews are still battling the 927,000-acre, multicounty Dixie fire and the 217,000-acre Caldor fire burning near South Lake Tahoe.
"We're right smack in the middle of wildfire peak season," Chief Thom Porter of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said this week. "Everybody needs to remain vigilant."
The National Weather Service said much of the fire zone, including Plumas and Lassen counties and the South Lake Tahoe area, will be hit with gusty winds and the chance of thunderstorms Friday, although a cooling trend should bring temperatures down in the days to come.
Dry lightning strikes -- which last year spurred a rash of wildfires in the fall -- are a possibility. A fire weather watch has been issued across much of Northern California through 11 p.m. Friday.
While the fires have forced thousands to flee their homes, they have driven many others to stay indoors with their windows shut against the toxic smoke. Barreca, of UCLA, said that could be a deadly pattern for people without air conditioning during a heat wave.
And McKinnon noted that the extreme weather behaviors plaguing the state -- including fire, heat and drought -- are all connected. The stagnant high-pressure system that created many of the summer's "heat domes" are also associated with low precipitation and heating of the state's surface.
"The warming of temperatures overall can lead to drying, and that drying later in the season can lead to warming, and all of those things can lead to enhanced wildfire," she said. "Basically, it's all linked."

We blew the climate change dress rehearsal

COVID-19 is a nightmare that has left more than 600,000 people dead in the United States alone. But from the very start it was also a clear dress rehearsal for the looming global catastrophe of climate change, which is barreling toward us and likely to wreak more damage than the pandemic.
Early on, it seemed as if COVID might sober us up, and teach us some useful lessons for that other great and imminent threat. Perhaps the coronavirus would force us to acknowledge that there really are invisible dangers in the world, and that there really are experts who know more than we do. Perhaps it would show us that if we don't act to avert crises sooner rather than later, the problems only get worse.
Climate activist Bill McKibben suggested something along those lines. "This might be the moment when we decide to fully embrace the idea that science, you know, works," he wrote back in March 2020. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called COVID-19 a "wake-up call" for climate change.
But here in the United States, we did not rise to the occasion. We did not wake up. Instead, we bungled much of our response to COVID, making the situation worse than it had to be. It's not clear we learned much of anything as a nation.
I was reminded of that again Monday when the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued its most dire report yet (each has been more dire than the last). The IPCC concluded that humans can no longer reverse some of climate change's effects or stop its intensification over the next three decades. Therefore, we should expect more raging storms, devastating heat waves, harrowing floods, out-of-control fires, severe droughts and other "extreme events unprecedented in the observational record."
That wasn't the part that bothered me. I expected no less.
What bothered me was the frustrating conclusion that we could still head off the most devastating climate change effects if we took immediate concerted action. Sharp cuts in carbon emissions beginning right now could make an enormous difference in what lies ahead.
It's frustrating because why think that any such thing will happen? Isn't concerted action what Americans just showed we cannot do -- pull together, sacrifice together, expect that Washington will behave rationally or that our leaders will lead? I'm pleased there's still hope, but what indication is there that we will avail ourselves of it?
In response to the pandemic here in the U.S., many millions of people behaved responsibly, wore masks, got shots and made sacrifices for more than a year.
But many, many millions of others responded by denying the facts and disbelieving the science. They chose stubbornness and know-nothingism. They chose shortsightedness. Some were misinformed; others were in the grip of fantastical conspiracy theories.
Worse yet, many elected officials, led by then-President Trump, were willing to politicize the pandemic, spreading bad information or encouraging misbehavior. Some merely kept quiet, like the New Mexico mayor quoted in The Times on Monday who says he no longer urges his constituents to get vaccinated: "You could lose votes for pushing the vaccine too much."
That kind of gutlessness is why case numbers are going up and new virus variants are threatening to send us all back into hiding. Only about 58% of vaccine-eligible Americans are fully immunized.
COVID could have been stopped much sooner. A minor step like getting a shot in the arm -- how difficult is that? It's not an affront to liberty to ask people to get a lifesaving vaccination.
If people won't get vaccinated or wear masks, how can they be expected to transform their lives as climate change requires? Answer: They can't.
And fighting climate change is even harder than fighting COVID in this sense: With COVID, there's no trillion-dollar industry with a vested interest in making sure you don't believe in it.
Unfortunately, neither the capitalist system (which too often encourages corporations to maximize profits at society's expense) nor our democratic system (which allows citizens to toss out politicians who call for unpleasant efforts) seems particularly well-suited to meet the climate battle.
Here's what the IPCC report says: Melting ice and rising sea levels are accelerating. Extreme weather events are worsening. Even if we cut emissions drastically now, some climate changes are "locked-in" and will be "irreversible" for centuries. In about a decade, we're expected to barrel past the limits on warming that the Paris pact sought to set.
The pandemic dress rehearsal didn't go so well. And with each passing year, each passing presidential administration, each rise in temperature, each new season of wildfire or flood or drought -- the problems ahead become deeper and harder to solve.
The lessons of COVID ought to be clear: We cannot dismiss science or blithely ignore what we know is coming at us. We need to work together, look out for others and accept that sacrifices will be necessary, as we have sometimes done in wartime.
We need leaders -- Republicans and Democrats alike -- who will acknowledge reality and instead of pandering for votes at any cost, press us to meet our obligations to the world and to each other. The threat to the planet is real, and we won't be saved by self-delusion, conspiracy theories or stubborn, studied ignorance.

BUSINESS; Climate woes may show in your cup of joe; Rising coffee prices, and food costs in general, are partly due to global warming.

Climate change is such a massive problem, with such potentially catastrophic ramifications, many people have trouble getting their heads around the danger we face.
So let's put things in simpler terms.
Climate change means you'll be paying more for coffee, every day, for possibly the rest of your life.
And it may not taste as good.
"U.S. consumers should expect much more expensive and lower-quality coffee because of rising temperatures, extreme rainfalls, and higher frequency of severe droughts," said Titus O. Awokuse, chairman of the department of agricultural, food and resource economics at Michigan State University.
"Recent studies show that up to 60% of high-quality coffee species are at risk of extinction because of the negative impacts of climate change," he told me.
There. Got your attention now?
Climate change isn't just an environmental issue. It's a consumer issue.
The cost of food is rising. That's partly due to supply and labor issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
But it's also a reflection of how our planet's changing climate is affecting crops, livestock and other food sources.
"Prices reflect supply and demand, and if production costs rise or supply becomes more constrained, prices will rise," said Carolyn Dimitri, an associate professor of nutrition and food studies at New York University.
"Climate change is likely to increase production costs and reduce supply, at least in some years," she predicted, adding that she would be "horrified" if decent coffee became harder to come by.
"I will pay just about any price for my coffee," Dimitri said, echoing my own thoughts and, I suspect, those of millions of other coffee drinkers.
Coffee futures recently jumped to the highest level in four years, due in part to extreme weather in Brazil, the world's largest coffee producer.
Factor in pandemic-related supply issues, and the cost of coffee beans has risen more than 40% so far this year.
Because caffeine heavyweights such as Starbucks and Nestle buy their coffee supplies well in advance, not all dealers of our daily fix will be raising prices immediately.
But some are already warning of higher retail costs.
J.M. Smucker, maker of Folgers and Dunkin' ground coffee, said it has no choice but to jack up prices. "We are seeing inflationary costs impacting the entire fiscal year," the company's chief financial officer said during a recent conference call.
Coffee is just one item on supermarket shelves that's getting more expensive because of climate change.
Harsh weather is driving up the cost of sugar. Wheat prices are now at the highest level in nearly eight years.
Corn, soybeans, avocados, almonds, honey, citrus -- all are more expensive.
And this isn't just in America. According to the United Nations, food prices worldwide were up by 33% in August from a year before.
"Climate change is a contributor because climate variability, extreme events and sustained droughts in certain regions can reduce yields and hence supplies," said Sanford Eigenbrode, a professor of entomology at the University of Idaho.
This isn't to say we're doomed. Some experts believe global food production will adjust to a changing climate.
"Climate change will not affect agriculture the same way in all parts of the world," said Ellen Bruno, an agricultural economist at UC Berkeley. "We have a lot of adaptive capacity."
In other words, crops that start failing in some parts of the world may thrive in others.
Overall, however, climate change is reaching -- or has already reached, by some estimates -- a point of no return. And this all but guarantees higher food costs in the future.
A recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world's leading authority on climate science, found that droughts that previously occurred perhaps once a decade are now 70% more frequent than in the preindustrial era.
Climate change obviously poses a greater threat than just pricier meals. It means hotter temperatures, heavier rainfall, more droughts, rising sea levels, flooding of coastal areas and other dystopian prospects.
Solutions for a problem of this scope aren't easy. Nations around the world are being called upon to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adopt more eco-friendly energy sources.
These measures are challenging and expensive, and require both unity and sacrifice -- two things that aren't always easy in a world guided mostly by self-interest and short-sightedness.
What you can do -- what you should do -- is support politicians who recognize the danger and who are prepared to rise above selfish interests and show necessary leadership during a time of global crisis.
Also consider taking your business to companies that are willing to play a role in addressing climate change, although it's not always clear how serious some corporations are in this regard.
Institutional Shareholder Services has found that just over a third of Standard & Poor's 500 companies have set ambitious climate change targets. The rest have modest goals or no climate change plans at all.
Some tech and retail heavyweights, including Microsoft and Walmart, have been among the most aggressive in laying out plans to become "carbon neutral" in coming years.
But others, especially those in the heavily polluting energy sector, have been cagier about their intentions or have resisted overhauling operations for the sake of planetary survival.
As I said up top, this is tough stuff, requiring tough, sweeping solutions -- the sort of behavior that human beings historically have not shown themselves to be very good at.
So keep the focus tight. If nothing else, think about the food you eat. Think about your daily coffee habit. Hell, think about my daily coffee habit.
"People in the U.S. have enjoyed a long period where crop yields have increased and food prices have declined," said Dane Scott, a professor of environmental ethics at the University of Montana. "That period is likely over."
He told me price hikes are now "inevitable."
"Consumers should expect to pay more for food products to help finance the enormous undertaking of adapting agriculture to a changing climate," Scott said. "The greater the disruption to the Earth's climate system, the greater the social and economic costs of adaptation."
And your grande, quad, nonfat, one-pump, no-whip mocha is no exception.

PERSPECTIVES; Climate change no longer sparing wealthy countries; North American fires and floods in Europe show broad reach of extreme weather.

As the world staggers through another summer of extreme weather, experts are noticing something different: 2021's onslaught is hitting harder and in places that have been spared global warming's wrath in the past.
Wealthy countries including the United States, Canada, Germany and Belgium are joining poorer and more vulnerable nations on a growing list of places suffering extreme weather events that scientists say have some connection to human-caused climate change.
"It is not only a poor-country problem -- it's now very obviously a rich-country problem," said Debby Guha-Sapir, founder of the international disaster database at the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters at Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium. "[The rich] are getting whacked."
Killer floods hit China, but hundreds also drowned in parts of Germany and Belgium not used to being inundated. Canada and the Pacific Northwest had what climate scientist Zeke Hausfather called "scary" heat that soared past triple digits, shattering records and accompanied by unusual wildfires. Now, southern Europe is seeing unprecedented heat and fire.
And peak Atlantic hurricane and U.S. wildfire seasons are only just starting.
When what would become Hurricane Elsa formed July 1, it broke last year's record for the earliest fifth-named Atlantic storm. Colorado State University has already increased its forecast for the number of named Atlantic storms. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will update its season outlook on Wednesday.
For fire season, the U.S. West is the driest it has been since 1580, based on soil-moisture readings and tree-ring records, setting the stage for worsening fires if something ignites them, said UCLA climate and fire scientist Park Williams.
What happens with U.S. hurricane and fire seasons drives the end-of-year statistics for total damage costs of weather disasters, said Ernst Rauch, chief climate and geoscientist for insurance giant Munich Re. So far this year, he said, wealthier regions have seen the biggest economic losses.
When poorer countries are hit, they are less prepared and their people can't use air conditioning or leave, so there's more harm to human life, said Hausfather, climate director of the Breakthrough Institute. Although hundreds of people died in the Pacific Northwest heat wave, he said the number would have been much higher in poor areas.
Madagascar, an island nation off East Africa, is in the middle of consecutive droughts that the United Nations warns are pushing 400,000 people toward starvation.
Although it's too early to say that the summer of 2021 will break records for climate disasters, "we're certainly starting to see climate change push extreme events into new territories where they haven't been seen before," Hausfather said.
The number of weather, water and climate disasters so far this year is only slightly higher than the average of recent years, said disaster researcher Guha-Sapir. Her group's database, which she said is still missing many events, shows 208 such disasters worldwide through July -- about 11% more than the last decade's average, but a bit less than last year.
Last year, the record-shattering heat was in Siberia, where few people live, but this year it struck Portland, Ore., and British Columbia, which is getting more Western media attention, Hausfather said.
What's happening is "partly an increase in the statistics of these extreme events, but also just that the steady drumbeat, the pile on year-on-year ... takes its cumulative toll on all of us who are reading these headlines," said Georgia Tech climate scientist Kim Cobb.
"This pattern of recent Northern Hemisphere summers has been really quite stark," said climate scientist Peter Stott of the University of Exeter.
Although overall temperature rise is "playing out exactly as we said 20 years ago, ... what we are seeing in terms of the heat waves and the floods is more extreme than we predicted back then," Stott said.
Climate scientists say there is little doubt climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas is driving extreme events.
Aside from floods and fires, heat waves are a major risk to prepare for in the future, Guha-Sapir said.
"It's going to be a very big deal in the Western countries because the most susceptible to sudden peaks of heat are older people. And the demographic profile of the people in Europe is very old," she said.

Climate change led to 37% of heat deaths in study

More than one-third of the world's heat deaths each year are due directly to global warming, according to the latest study to calculate the human cost of climate change.
Scientists say that these deaths are only a sliver of climate change's overall toll -- even more people die from other extreme weather that has been amplified by global warming, such as storms, flooding and drought -- and that the number of people killed by heat will grow exponentially with rising temperatures.
Dozens of researchers who looked at heat deaths in 732 cities around the globe from 1991 to 2018 calculated that 37% were caused by higher temperatures from human-caused warming, according to a study Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change.
That adds up to about 9,700 people a year from just those cities, but it is much more worldwide, the study's lead author said.
"These are deaths related to heat that actually can be prevented. It is something we directly cause," said Ana Vicedo-Cabrera, an epidemiologist at the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine at the University of Bern in Switzerland.
The highest percentages of heat deaths caused by climate change were in cities in South America. Vicedo-Cabrera pointed to southern Europe and southern Asia as other places with high numbers of climate-related heat deaths.
Sao Paulo, Brazil, which is South America's most populous city, has the most climate-related heat deaths, averaging 239 a year, researchers found.
About 35% of heat deaths in the United States can be blamed on climate change, the study found. That's a total of more than 1,100 deaths a year in about 200 U.S. cities, with the most deaths, 141, in New York. Honolulu had the highest portion of heat deaths attributable to climate change -- 82%.
Scientists used decades of mortality data in the 732 cities to plot curves detailing how each city's death rate changes with temperature and how the heat-death curves vary from city to city. Some cities adapt to heat better than others due to air conditioning, cultural factors and environmental conditions, Vicedo-Cabrera said.
Then researchers compared observed temperatures with 10 computer models simulating a world without human-caused climate change. By applying that scientifically accepted technique to the individualized heat-death curves for the 732 cities, the scientists calculated extra heat deaths from climate change.
"People continue to ask for proof that climate change is already affecting our health. This attribution study directly answers that question using state-of- the-science epidemiological methods, and the amount of data the authors have amassed for analysis is impressive," said Dr. Jonathan Patz, director of the Global Health Institute at the University of Wisconsin.
Patz, who wasn't part of the study, said it was one of the first to detail climate-change-related heat deaths now rather than projecting future deaths.

PERSPECTIVES; Firms told to come clean on climate change

Chevron, one of the world's leading oil companies, got a major wake-up call on climate change from shareholders May 26.
At its annual meeting that day, a stunning 60.7% of shareholders voted for the company to "substantially" reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.
The vote was surprising for a couple of reasons.
One was its magnitude. Majority votes in favor of shareholder resolutions opposed by corporate management, as this one was, are exceedingly rare in corporate America.
The other was that it supported a policy sharply at odds with the company's long-held business model.
"This was an ask that a couple of years ago would have been a very hard sell to most investors," said Andrew Logan, an oil and gas expert at Ceres, a Boston nonprofit that helps develop sustainability strategies for industry.
But investors have been asking for much more from corporate managements -- more disclosures about how their activities contribute to climate change, and more about how climate change will affect their destinies.
Nor are these demands coming only to fossil fuel producers. They're being felt by manufacturers, retailers, bankers -- almost any company exposed to global climate change.
"Investors want to know how a company is preparing for a different world where there's more regulatory change and more environmental change," said Ann Lipton, a business law expert at Tulane University who has been tracking corporate responses to these inquiries.
The pressure isn't coming only from investors. In March, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a call for public comment on climate change disclosure. More than 5,500 comments have come in, most of them endorsing greater disclosure.
The SEC request signals the agency's intention to issue some sort of rule mandating greater disclosure, though the rule-making is probably a few years off.
Consumers and employees are increasingly interested in how the companies they buy from or work for are dealing with their effect on the environment.
Corporate governance expert Nell Minow mentioned signs one might see at the seafood counter attesting that the products on display were caught by sustainable methods. "That's the market speaking," she told me. She pointed to a "huge demographic shift -- the millennials and Gen Z are much more sensitive on these issues than their parents were, as employees, as consumers and as investors."
That may be contributing to the dramatically increased interest in so-called ESG investing -- for environmental, social and governance. ESG mutual funds, which were designed to exclude tobacco and oil companies and other arguably bad actors, were once a small corner of the investing world.
"ESG is the fastest-growing area of investment products I can ever remember seeing," Minow said. "That shows that the people in charge of marketing financial products realize this is an idea whose time has come."
Shareholder resolutions may be the best way to measure investor interest in ESG issues -- and they're showing that such interest is rising sharply.
To date, there have been 34 majority votes for ESG proposals, handily outpacing last year's record 21, according to Proxy Preview, a publication that tracks shareholder resolutions. Last year, only two votes broke 70% approval. This year, the figure was 17.
At two companies, managements supported environmental proposals: a demand for a deforestation impact report at the agribusiness Bunge, which received 98.8% support, and one for a report on greenhouse gas reduction goals at General Electric, which prevailed with a 98% vote.
What's uncertain is how other corporate managements will respond to the warning signs represented by these resolutions. By law, the votes are only advisory, meaning that managements can ignore them if they dare.
That's not a wise choice, as Chevron has discovered. Last year, a shareholder resolution asking the giant oil company to report how its lobbying activities "align with the goal of limiting average global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius (the Paris Climate Agreement's goal)" passed with 53% of the vote.
The company responded in December with a 12-page report that vaguely cited the lobbying of trade associations in which Chevron was a member, but with few figures or other quantitative information about its own activities.
"That was an unsatisfying response to a real expression of displeasure from investors," Logan said. "You saw that at the annual meeting this year, when a majority of investors endorsed a climate change proposal with a bit of a harder bite to it."
Investors at Exxon Mobil took an even harder stance at that company's annual meeting, held the same day as Chevron's. There, three nominees of the activist hedge fund Engine No. 1, which is seeking a more aggressive response to climate change from the company, won election to the company's 12-member board. Shareholder votes on directors are mandatory, not advisory.
The vote reflected a "tidal wave" of investor concerns about ESG issues, Exxon Mobil director Ursula Burns acknowledged after the meeting.
Companies inclined to ignore pressures for more disclosure and more action on climate change and other issues won't be able to do so for long. European regulators are already demanding more disclosures, the SEC is likely to follow, and investor patience will wear thin.
"It's a ticking clock," Minow said. Speaking of the Exxon Mobil vote, she said: "If shareholders are not seeing progress and feel that the new directors are not being put in key board committee positions, there's another annual meeting next year, and they'll get a majority."

Not everyone believed in Captain Dan.
Other fishermen chuckled when he started giving boat tours of Noyo Harbor. Who would pay for a ride in a busy port, with its foul-mouthed sailors, its harbor seals clamoring for discarded fish guts, its vessels with names like Kraken and Dirty White Boat?
But in this Northern California harbor town of 7,300 people, Dan Platt -- a skipper with a salt-and-pepper mustache, quiet demeanor and affinity for being alone on the ocean -- became the epitome of rural reinvention. About five years after he began, rides on his 18-foot Duffy boat, the Noyo Star, are booked almost every day.
Platt certainly didn't guess life would turn out this way.
But the planet is warming, and the waters are changing. Rising ocean temperatures have upended marine ecosystems. Drought and record-breaking heat are drying up the rivers where salmon hatch before migrating to the sea.
"I kind of figured the tours would be my retirement when I finally do retire from fishing," said the 61-year-old Platt, who has spent his entire adult life commercial fishing. "It got to the point where I'm doing so many tours, I don't have any time to go fishing any more."
Along the economically distressed rural North Coast -- where the future lies not in the fishing and logging jobs that once defined it but, increasingly, in tourism -- climate change has forced those who live by the rod and the reel to consider their options.
Mendocino County is experiencing its worst drought on record, and residents' wells are running dry. Flows in the Noyo River -- Fort Bragg's main source of drinking water in the summer -- hit record lows this year. And it is increasingly salty thanks to rising sea levels and occasional "king tides," exceptionally high tides which push farther inland when the river runs low.
Fishing and diving seasons have become shorter and more tightly restricted, if they happen at all.
Early last month, Platt, who is known to his guests as Captain Dan, squeezed in two days of fishing aboard his commercial boat, the Zhivago, a converted Coast Guard vessel, as the salmon season opened. His hands were cut and raw. But the fish were biting -- and a good day on the water can still bring in as much money as a week's worth of tours.
Platt said out-of-town fishermen had been flocking to Fort Bragg and he was "leaving the fish to them" because he had so many tours. Previous salmon seasons have been canceled. Everyone knows there's no guarantee.
"I wouldn't be surprised if they actually shut it down," he said. "If the drought continues. If we don't get some rain."
As fishing becomes more tightly regulated, some have given up and sold their boats. Others now cast their nets for different kinds of fish. Laura Miller -- whose salmon troller, the Animal Fair, docks on the Noyo River -- started selling handmade jewelry on Etsy last year.
"It was a way of diversifying," said Miller, 44.
She and business partner Rich Holmes mostly used to harvest red urchin, until that fishery collapsed. They've fished for black cod, rockfish, hagfish and "dabbled in tuna."
"The life of a modern fisherman -- you have to be open to change and try new things," Miller said.
They're mostly relying upon salmon now. But as the drought dries the rivers those fish depend upon, that feels fragile.
"We just really love being out on the ocean and that lifestyle," said Holmes, 68. "We're hoping to continue doing it for many years to come; it's just beautiful out there. But it feels scary. ... I think quite a bit of change is in the future."
Holmes and Miller sell fish to the public directly off their boat. On his tours, Platt passes out their business card; they do the same for him.
Holmes initially thought the workaday Noyo Harbor wouldn't be a tourist destination. Turns out Captain Dan was right. "Dan's timing was really pretty decent," he said with a laugh.
Just as Platt was launching his boat tours, a chain reaction of environmental stressors began throwing the Northern California marine ecosystem into chaos.
In 2013, starfish began dying en masse from the mysterious sea star wasting syndrome. The plague wiped out huge sunflower sea stars, one of the main predators of purple urchins, a voracious creature nicknamed the "zombie urchin" that eats everything in its path, including rocks.
The purple urchin population exploded along the North Coast, and the urchins devoured kelp at the same time the so-called blob, a mass of warm seawater in the Pacific, made the water too hot for the kelp to thrive. Once-flourishing kelp forests -- a critical habitat for abalone, fish and other creatures -- are now vast urchin barrens, stretches of denuded ocean floor covered in spiny purple orbs.
The region's once-lucrative red urchin fishery collapsed and received federal disaster relief. Abalone diving, which brought people from all over the world to the Sonoma and Mendocino county coasts, was cut off in 2018 and is banned until at least 2026.
Over the last few years, Sheila Semans, executive director of the Noyo Center for Marine Science, has had stunned divers whose favorite abalone spots are now urchin barrens sit in her office and weep.
The Noyo Center now collaborates with other organizations, like Reef Check, and universities, sending divers -- including red urchin commercial divers who needed work -- to remove purple urchins by hand.
Although red urchin typically provide uni for sushi restaurants, purple urchin are edible too. Conservation groups and companies are now taking smaller purple urchins from the barrens to carefully monitored "ranches" where they are fattened up before being sold as seafood.
"We're in this weird period of time where what is right from an economic standpoint is also right from an environmental standpoint," Semans said. "We need to make a new fishery out of these purple urchin."
"It's so much change, and for these small rural communities, it takes so much longer to adapt," she said.
For decades, many rural communities like Fort Bragg that once relied upon natural resource-based industries -- like fishing, logging or mining -- have tried to pivot to tourism, including plans to build a new marine science center on the site of the struggling lumber town's last sawmill. It's not an easy transition.
"The jobs that tourism brings, large proportions are service-industry jobs, are seasonal or part time, and don't lift a family above the poverty line," said Jennifer Sherman, an associate professor of sociology at Washington State University who focuses on rural communities.
Fort Bragg is trying to become a tourist town even as tensions rise between locals -- who are being asked to cut back water use during the drought -- and visitors who use a lot of it.
On a recent weekend, nearly every hotel in town was completely booked. Lines formed outside the fish and chip joints along the river. Boat slips were filled with out-of-town vessels at the start of the salmon season.
Pickup trucks parked by the harbor bore bumper stickers with credos like: "No Farmed Salmon in Eureka!" and "Support Local Fishermen. DEMAND Wild California King Salmon."
Aboard the Noyo Star, Platt sailed visitors on the river's blue-green water at about 3 mph, the waves gently lapping against his boat.
The pragmatic seafarer is more reserved than a typical tour guide. But people are still romantic about fishing, so he describes the mechanics of the boats in the harbor and explains what commercial fishing entails.
On a recent afternoon, Paul Batterson, 80, of Sacramento County, climbed off Platt's boat behind his four grandchildren, ages 7 to 14.
He had spent months teaching them supplemental history lessons while they were distance-learning during the pandemic. The most recent lessons were about the history of food, and Platt's boat served as the perfect classroom.
They talked about the urchin business, about rock cod and sablefish.
"We saw it in action," Batterson said. "They saw fishing boats coming in, they saw fishing boats getting unloaded at the docks, they saw fishing boats getting fuel."
Other tour-goers are fleeing wildfire smoke farther inland and seeking outdoor activities amid the pandemic.
"It's been amazingly good," Platt said. "I meet a lot of people."
He was especially relieved to have the tours to complement his fishing income last year. He had a hard time selling fish with so many restaurants shut down during the pandemic.
Platt spent his early childhood in Southern California, where his father, a collegiate physical education teacher, was outspoken about his opposition to the Vietnam War and the draft. His father's school told him to "cool it or leave," Platt said. So, he packed up his family, moved to the North Coast, and bought a commercial fishing boat.
As a young man in the 1980s, Platt spent years aboard boats in Alaska. That was back when crabbing in the Last Frontier was like a gold rush on the sea -- before the Alaskan king crab population suddenly plunged, sending crews into bankruptcy.
Ultimately, he came back to Fort Bragg because he had two young daughters. When he was home, he carried his babies in backpacks to take them fishing. He put the girls through diving lessons and cooked seafood, as fresh as could be. But he was missing too many Christmases.
"Talk to them now, and they'll tell you, 'Dad wasn't around very much when we were growing up,'" he said. "I'm trying to make up for it now."
He runs Noyo Harbor Tours with daughter Kristin, 32, who handles the booking, answering calls from early morning to midnight. She carries a tide book everywhere she goes, planning trips around the waves.
Kristin and her father are close, even though, for her and her sister, his long absences when they were children were "kind of annoying to us, to be honest."
Just as Captain Dan learned how to fish with his dad, she learned how to run a tour business with hers. She sees it as a family business that lasts "years and years."
She has a hard time imagining life away from the water, despite how fickle and troubled it can be in these times.
"The ocean is part of me," she said.
On a recent afternoon, as Platt steered through the harbor, his phone kept buzzing: Sunset tour booked. Afternoon tour booked.
Platt suddenly pointed at the water, delighted. "Look! There's a harbor seal. Right in front of us. Just kinda chilling there in the water."
Even after a lifetime aboard boats, the water has not lost its wonder.

IF AUTUMN 2021 is anything like last year, hordes of Angelenos will flock to the beach in mid-October, seeking refuge from a heat wave. Some will trek north, to Malibu's high bluffs and boulder-lined shores; others south, to the picturesque La Jolla seaside.
And some people will head downtown, to the Museum of Contemporary Art's Geffen Contemporary.
"Sun & Sea," the climate-crisis opera that earned the top prize at the 2019 Venice Biennale, will make its West Coast premiere at the Geffen Contemporary on Oct. 14. The L.A. production -- part contemporary opera, part crowdsourced performance art, part diorama come to life -- is a joint presentation of MOCA, the Hammer Museum and the Center for the Art of Performance at UCLA. Directors of all three organizations -- Klaus Biesenbach, Ann Philbin and Kristy Edmunds, respectively -- joined forces to bring the work here as part of a U.S. tour.
The piece -- directed by Rugil? Barzd?iukait?, written by Vaiva Grainyt? and scored by Lina Lapelyt?, all Lithuanian women -- addresses climate change in what could best be described as an operatic lament about the disintegration of our planet. Audience members will watch the performance from a U-shaped balcony, looking down onto a beach bathed in high noon sunlight -- the Geffen Contemporary, transformed with 10 to 20 tons of locally sourced sand. Thirteen singers and eight non-singing performers, all part of the Lithuanian company Neon Realism, will relax on towels, slather on sunscreen, play badminton, nibble on snacks and build sandcastles as they perform the libretto, translated from Lithuanian into English. A live dog and several children fill out the crowd amid ambient beach noise -- chatter and laughter, the crinkling of food wrappers, a popping volleyball -- layered over the recorded musical soundscape and live singing.
Soloists -- playing societal archetypes such as a wealthy family, a retired couple, a single 20-something woman -- wax anxiously poetic about the destruction of Australia's Great Barrier Reef, the warming Earth and species extinction as well as global tourism's effect on the planet. The result is a disquieting tension between the happy-go-lucky, voracious and profitable leisure industry and looming environmental catastrophe, conveyed with somewhat ironic levity by a panoply of swimsuit-clad characters in an otherwise merry setting.
"It's sending a message that is
so profound," Philbin says. "But in the subtlest, most beautiful way that it's disturbing."
The staging of the opera is particularly fluid, like the weather. The production is an hour long but repeats for a five-hour stretch without any pause, from 4 to 9 p.m., for three days. Audience members stay for just one presentation, but for the performers, it's "endurance art," as Biesenbach puts it -- they don't stop singing, even as the audience members swap out.
The performers can leave the beach-stage at any point during the five hours for a bathroom break or a snack, but when they return, they will be soaking wet -- the implication being that they've taken a dip in the ocean. Meantime, audience members can wander around the balcony, viewing the production from different vantages. A QR code will provide access to the program and lyrics.
The production is especially top-of-mind now, after the recent release of a U.N. report on climate change that was characterized as "a code red for humanity." "The company is very aware of the fires in California, the flooding and the hurricane spillover on the East Coast, heat waves in Arkansas," Edmunds says. "It doesn't change the lyrics, but it allowed them to feel knowledgeable about the things we're facing."
The audience's vantage point -- a bird's-eye view -- is critical.
"Looking down suggests you're looking at the Earth," Philbin says. "And it's about the Earth."
"You're a witness but you're in it also," Biesenbach says.
"As if you are an animal, flying over," Edmunds adds.
There's a charged collegiality among the directors as they offer a tour of the soon-to-be-transformed Geffen. It's partly due to their passion for the project -- each saw different iterations of it in Italy or Lithuania but all were moved, they say -- and partly because of the fast-paced, last-minute execution of the project. They partnered up only in May.
"Sun & Sea" debuted at the National Gallery of Art in Lithuania in 2017 before premiering at the Venice Biennale in 2019, where people waited in hours-long lines for performances. The production won the Golden Lion for national presentation, generating yet more buzz. A European tour kicked off in March 2020 and is still underway.
Philbin had dreamed of bringing the opera to Los Angeles, but it's an unconventional and complex production to stage, even in pre-pandemic times, and after COVID-19 hit, it didn't seem realistic. Then she learned, in May, that the U.S. tour had a spot open. She reached out to Edmunds, who runs a sister organization at UCLA, but the two soon realized they needed a large, flexible warehouse-like space with soaring ceilings. The Geffen was a natural fit.
"I was in New York, for Frieze [art fair]," Biesenbach says of getting Philbin's call. "I was just screaming, in a taxi. But it was so joyful."
"I didn't even finish my sentence," Philbin adds, "and he went: 'I'm in!' "
The Hammer took on an administrative and fundraising role; CAP UCLA handled the logistics around live performance; and MOCA took on the transformation of the Geffen.
The collaboration itself was very much in the spirit of the opera.
"The feeling, when you see it, is: We're in this together," Biesenbach says. "And this is the one thing -- ecology -- we have to work together on."
The U.S. tour kicks off in mid-September at the Brooklyn Academy of Music before heading to Philadelphia's Arcadia Exhibitions at Arcadia University as part of the city's Fringe Festival in late September. It then goes to the Momentary, a satellite space of Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Ark., in early October before arriving in L.A.
In previous stagings of "Sun & Sea," local volunteers from the public joined the cast on the beach. They didn't sing; they simply added to the background activity, improv-style. The upcoming Brooklyn, Philadelphia and Arkansas stagings will include community participation.
In Los Angeles, the community participation role will be filled by 10 members from the choral ensemble Tonality.
"We felt that it was important -- especially in COVID and especially after performance makers have had zero income for over a year -- that the local folks we incorporate be artists that perform, can collaborate with this international company and that we cover the payment for them," Edmunds says.
She helped cast Tonality -- a "BIPOC-forward, social justice professional chorus of Angelenos," as she describes it -- for the opera, with an eye toward adding authenticity to the beach scene.
Different races, ages, body types, gender identities, sexual identities -- "You'll see a snapshot across the very diverse Los Angeles that we understand," she says.
"Which wasn't the case in Venice," Philbin adds. "It reflected a more European crowd."
The sand will come from an Irwindale quarry. Although sourcing and transporting it does have an environmental footprint, as do performers and other creatives traveling internationally on tour, the climate-minded production is thinking about sustainability. After the production ends, the sand will be given to local schools and playgrounds to replenish sandboxes.
Edmunds' team will collect rocks, shells and driftwood to round out the Geffen beach, giving it a local feel.
Core costume and set design elements, however, are uniform city to city. The color palette of performers' beachwear is a spectrum of pastels -- rose, sage, light yellow -- and there are no bright colors or logos on towels and umbrellas. The result is a muted, nostalgic feeling.
Under the harsh, faux-noon sunlight, performers' exposed skin appears in ever-present danger of being sunburned, both a commentary on ozone depletion and UV exposure as well as a theatrical device adding an undercurrent of threat.
"The light is kind of brutal and makes you feel vulnerable," Biesenbach says. "It doesn't soothe -- it feels like it hurts you."
The soundscape -- a recorded mix of electronic music and nature sounds along with the live singing -- is a living "sonic sculpture," Edmunds says. Sixteen speakers are tucked under the balcony scaffolding and elsewhere, so that the experience feels immersive.
The production overall is marked by "interdependence," the directors say -- among the three Los Angeles institutions, for one, and between tour organizers and local venues. Between performers -- adults and children, humans and canines -- and their participating audiences. Even within the notes of the opera itself.
"The opera isn't standing arias of operatic frill," Edmunds says. "It's the singing voice that is continuously present throughout the community. Everyone in the cast steps forward when someone leaves. There's an interdependence through the music."
Ultimately, she adds, the artists behind "Sun & Sea" are "practicing a deep ethic of optimism" with the production.
"They wouldn't make something dark or full of lamentation or provocation that is emotionally difficult," she says, "if it didn't also create something cathartic."

We're being flooded with extreme weather; Scientists are studying the link between climate change and the jet stream, which is the driving force behind major global weather events

Reading the news over the last month - or maybe just stepping outside - you could get the sense that something has gone wrong with the weather. One heat wave after another has struck the West Coast, which, as a result, is now on fire. Western Europe has been deluged by rain, killing hundreds. Across Asia, from Japan to Turkey, temperature records have been falling like dominoes, and, most recently, several cities in China have been flooded by heavy rainfall.
The question on everyone's mind is whether this confluence of catastrophes is being caused by climate change. On one level the answer is a clear yes: Climate change puts more heat into the atmosphere, which directly causes high temperatures and indirectly increases the intensity of rainstorms by allowing air to hold more water vapor. But the approximately two-degree Fahrenheit increase in global average surface temperature caused by climate change so far represents only a relatively minor part of any single event. If Portland had reached 114 degrees at the end of June rather than 116, it would still have been the hottest day in the city's history. If Western Germany had received 7% less rain (that is, if we subtract out the additional moisture the atmosphere can currently hold thanks to climate change), it would still have experienced more than a month's worth of rainfall in a single day.
In fact, the true driving force behind all this extreme weather is the same: The behavior of the jet stream. The jet stream is the large band of strong wind that makes your flight from the U.S. to London shorter (and the return trip longer), and it plays a crucial role in determining the weather of the Northern Hemisphere. For one, it serves as something of a dividing line between two major air masses: the hot, wet air of the tropics and the cold, dry air of the Arctic.
When the jet stream bends toward Texas, temperatures in the U.S. fall as cold air is allowed to rush south. The reverse occurs when it bends north. But just as importantly, the jet stream also pulls the weather with it as it rushes along -- if it's raining in Boston on Tuesday, then by Wednesday the clouds will typically have been blown away and replaced with a new system.
All of this, though, assumes that the jet stream is moving along an approximately straight course, like an interstate slicing across the country from west to east. If, instead, its path develops large waves, like a meandering back road, this causes problems for those of us living underneath it. For one, it causes unseasonable weather to fill in the pockets, allowing tropical air to rush up into the northern parts of the country and producing the sorts of heat domes that have been responsible for record-breaking temperatures. But it also causes the jet stream to slow down, not unlike traffic on the winding road. This means that one hot, or cold, or rainy, day stretches into a week, prolonging the suffering and vastly increasing the risks to human life. Over the last month, the jet stream has resembled a switchback trail, causing weather pileups around the globe.
The scary question we should be asking is not if human activity is making heat waves hotter and rainstorms rainier -- it is. The question is whether our activity is also making these weather events more frequent and longer-lasting by kinking up the jet stream. This is an active area of research as the links between a wavy jet stream and climate change are not altogether clear. Some scientists believe that the warming climate won't have much of an effect on the jet stream, while others think that the planet's rising temperatures will lead to a slower, more meandering jet stream.
This latter possibility is what should really be keeping us up at night (well, that and the oppressive heat). If further studies show that the jet stream is becoming wavier, then we can all anticipate a lot more summers where the weather stops making sense.

BUSINESS; Google cracks down on false climate ads; Policy also applies to YouTube content that monetizes such misinformation.

Google is cracking down on digital ads promoting false climate change claims or being used to make money from such content, hoping to limit revenue for climate change deniers and stop the spread of misinformation on its platforms.
The company said Thursday in a blog post that the new policy would also apply to YouTube, which last week announced a sweeping crackdown on vaccine misinformation.
"We've heard directly from a growing number of our advertising and publisher partners who have expressed concerns about ads that run alongside or promote inaccurate claims about climate change," Google said. "Advertisers simply don't want their ads to appear next to this content."
Likewise, publishers and creators on YouTube "don't want ads promoting these claims to appear on their pages or videos," according to Google.
The restrictions "will prohibit ads for, and monetization of, content that contradicts well-established scientific consensus around the existence and causes of climate change," the blog post said.
Along with addressing publishers' frustrations, the changes are also apparently intended to counter online influencers who monetize, or make money from, YouTube videos promoting climate change denial theories by putting ads on them.
Limits will be placed on content calling climate change a hoax or denying that greenhouse gas emissions and human activity have contributed to Earth's long-term warming, the company said.
Google will use both automated tools and human reviewers to enforce the policy when it takes effect in November for publishers and YouTube creators and in December for advertisers.
Advertisements will still be allowed on content that's about related topics such as public debates on climate policy or the various effects of climate change.
The company is one of the two dominant players in the global digital ad industry, earning $147 billion in ad revenue last year. Facebook prohibits ads used to spread misinformation, though it doesn't list specific topics.
Earlier this week, Google rolled out new features aimed at helping users reduce their carbon footprints, including a search function that shows which flights have lower emissions.
Misinformation and the role that social media giants play in amplifying it have become a big concern for many people. Some 95% of Americans said misinformation is a problem when trying to access important information, according to a poll Friday from the Pearson Institute and the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.
Facebook's problem with false information came into the spotlight this week when Frances Haugen, a former data scientist-turned-whistleblower, told members of Congress that the company knows its platform spreads misinformation but refuses to make changes that could hurt its profits.

CALIFORNIA RECALL ELECTION; Elder vows to end 'war' on oil, gas; Candidate has harsh words for Newsom on fires, but ignores role of climate change.

Radio talk show host Larry Elder slammed California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday as "utterly incompetent" in reducing the forest fuels that power the state's massive wildfires, part of a broad critique in which the top challenger in the state's recall election also trashed the state's stringent environmental laws and promoted the use of climate-warming carbon-based fuels.
Elder suggested in a video news conference with U.S. Rep. Doug LaMalfa (R-Richvale) that he would end the "war on oil and gas" and the "attack on the logging industry," adding that he would reduce regulation of fracking and de-emphasize wind and solar power, which he called "not very efficient."
Elder's views put him outside the political mainstream in California but in concert with political conservatives.
The state has been one of the nation's leaders in turning away from the burning of coal, oil and other petroleum-based fuels, which scientists describe as major drivers of the global warming that intensifies wildfires. Conservatives contend that environmental regulations have gone too far and hamstrung the economy.
Elder's pronouncements have drawn increasing attention in recent weeks, as polls show him surging to the front of the dozens of contenders who want to replace Newsom if he is recalled in the Sept. 14 vote.
During the media event, the challenger continued to lash out at journalists he perceived as misrepresenting his record, took one of his first shots Wednesday at a fellow challenger and depicted himself as aligned with former President Trump on many issues but not a captive of his worldview.
Elder tried to keep the focus in his first extended news conference on the emotionally charged threat of wildfires. That could be fertile terrain in California, where ever-expanding blazes have taken scores of lives and caused billions of dollars in property damage.
Elder spoke from his home office in the Hollywood Hills, while LaMalfa -- one of his newest Republican supporters -- appeared from Plumas County, near the massive Dixie fire.
The main grist for Elder's attack came from a media report that showed the governor had not adhered to his own goals for forest "management;" the thinning of trees and underbrush that experts agree is essential to curtailing the damage from disasters such as the Dixie fire, the second-largest fire in California history.
"He's mismanaged the forests," Elder said of Newsom. "He gave a figure that was off by a factor of seven as to how many acres of fallen trees and dry vegetation that he's removed."
That referred to a June investigation by CapRadio, a Sacramento public radio outlet.
"I have no idea why this isn't being done," he said. "When I become governor, we're going to be implementing these commonsensical kinds of plans so that we can reduce the severity of these fires and save lives."
The public radio report found that Newsom claimed the state planned to remove fuel on 90,000 wildland acres but completed work on only a little more than 11,000 acres. CapRadio concluded that the governor "misrepresented his accomplishments and even disinvested in wildfire prevention."
Vast tracts of California forest are managed by the federal government and both California and U.S. officials acknowledge they need to do a better job of removing trees and other combustible material before giant fires break out.
The state and feds, until recently directed by Trump, set a goal of "treating" 500,000 acres a year. But both local and federal officials have fallen far short of that goal.
Newsom tried to regain momentum on the issue this year by pledging some $1.5 billion in "wildfire resiliency" work -- thinning overgrown forests, increasing prescribed burns and replanting trees. The governor's staff has said he is taking an "all-hands-on-deck approach to the wildfire crisis."
Experts expressed support for those promises but said they will be watching closely for follow-through.
Elder criticized Newsom for releasing 20,000 prison inmates early because of the threat from the COVID-19 pandemic. He suggested the felons should have been left locked up and would have provided manpower to fight the forest fires.
He also criticized the massive shift at Pacific Gas & Electric, one of the state's biggest utilities, to power derived from renewable sources. Elder said the spending on wind and solar power left "less money for removing trees and putting power lines underground; the kinds of things that would have made these fires less intense."
Newsom has taken a full-speed-ahead approach on the adoption of renewable fuels, electric vehicles and other reforms to reduce California's carbon footprint. Although Newsom constantly talks about climate change as driving the wildfire crisis, Elder did not mention global warming during his news conference.
"Do Californians really want to put someone who denied global warming in charge of fighting wildfires?" said Nathan Click, a spokesman for the anti-recall campaign. (Although Elder previously cast doubt on the reality of climate change, he has more recently said he believes it is real, is caused by human activity and contributes to the severity of wildfires, but he has decried climate change "alarmism.")
When reporters asked questions unrelated to the wildfire threat, Elder appeared irritated.
He again rejected the suggestion that he is a "Trump Republican," citing two policies on which he disagreed with the former president and four others on which he said he aligned with Trump.

The GOP's climate change; Five dozen House Republicans join a new caucus on global warming. It's late, but it's a start.

Faced with polls showing not only that most Americans want more done about climate change, but that a majority of Republicans feel the same way, a substantial number of GOP lawmakers are sounding a conciliatory note on the issue.
Sixty House Republicans have now joined a Conservative Climate Caucus, formed by Rep. John Curtis (R-Utah), that is willing at least to acknowledge the problem instead of labeling it a hoax, as President Trump did early on, or pretending that it's temporary and that human actions haven't contributed. Among its members are three Californians: Reps. David Valadao of Hanford, Michelle Steel of Seal Beach and Jay Obernolte of Big Bear Lake.
Republicans in both chambers appear ready to start talking -- and go a little bit further. The Senate recently voted 92 to 8 for the Growing Climate Solutions Act, which was supported by the Citizens' Climate Lobby. If it passes the House as expected and is signed into law by President Biden, it would ease the way for farmers and ranchers to earn and sell credits for reducing or mitigating greenhouse gas emissions.
That's progress, as is the less divisive approach. But in truth, the climate caucus and its somewhat more solutions-oriented tone are far too little, coming this late in the game.
Curtis talks about how he has spent a lot of time trying to understand the science, He and other Republicans needed to be quicker studies because the world is running out of time to avert the worst effects of climate change.
Worse, the caucus' public statements indicate that its members won't support reining in the use of fossil fuels in serious ways, as climate scientists insist we must do. Instead, the caucus calls those sources of greenhouse gases part of the solution to the need for stable sources of energy.
The caucus' other areas of interest -- safe nuclear energy and carbon sequestration -- are more promising, with caveats. If Republicans can somehow come up with a truly safe nuclear path, the nation will be all ears.
Right now, however, "safe nuclear" rings a little bit like the oxymoron "clean coal." And before any thought of expanding nuclear energy can occur, the country would first have to identify a place to store spent fuel rods and then figure out a foolproof way to transport them there.
The most stable forms of energy are the nearly infinite ones, such as solar and wind, not fuels that will eventually be tapped out (and that cause other environmental harms in their extraction). Nor does this country need to rely on foreign sources to maintain a steady supply of the sun.
It will be important for Republicans not to use this as a shield to convince America that they really do care about climate change and the increasingly frequent droughts, wildfires and extreme weather events, when in fact they aren't willing to take tough steps to soften future blows. Any discussion of environmental reform that excludes a drastic reduction in the use of fossil fuels is just happy talk, not reality.
Nor is it helpful to complain, as Curtis does, that nothing we do will matter much as long as China emits more carbon than the United States. On a per capita basis, this country still produces more greenhouse gas emissions, and China has been making major strides toward clean energy.
For now, incremental change is better than none at all. The reality is that support from both parties will be needed to pass important new climate change laws, and so the help of Republicans is welcome in accomplishing that -- as long as they don't demand concessions on the move to clean, sustainable energy in exchange for supporting tree-planting. With the mounting evidence all around us, the GOP should not have to be dragged kicking and screaming into admitting that there is a climate crisis and that it will require serious and sometimes uncomfortable commitments from the nation.

BUSINESS; Psst! Want to know a dirty secret?; State and U.S. regulators aim to unlock corporations' cagey plans to confront climate change

California clean tech innovator Bloom Energy, with its noncombustion, low-emission fuel cells, is hardly taking the same approach to powering the planet as oil giant Chevron, but one thing the companies have in common is slick promotional campaigns defining them as environmental pioneers.
That public relations savvy, though, has lately become a liability for both firms.
As they grapple with accusations of exaggerating their place in the green economy, many other businesses are taking notice. A push by the Biden administration and the state of California could soon force all public companies to be far more forthright about their preparedness -- or lack thereof -- for the disruptions created by climate change and about the size of their carbon footprint.
Unlocking the black box of corporate secrecy is a central pillar of federal and state plans for confronting warming, which are increasingly focused on requiring a wide range of businesses, including financial firms, food suppliers and tech giants, to be painstakingly -- perhaps uncomfortably -- specific with investors and the public. Even secret contributions to advocacy and political groups could soon be forced into the daylight.
"Companies can't say they have all these policies to reach goals and not pursue them," said Hana V. Vizcarra, a staff attorney at the Harvard Law School Environmental and Energy Law Program. "Regulators are really interested in this."
A frenzy of activity aimed at forcing corporate climate transparency is underway at the White House, in the California Capitol in Sacramento, and across federal financial regulatory agencies. The results could be transformative, potentially mandating that companies go beyond just revealing the emissions their products create to probing their supply chains, the pollution created when their products are discarded and possibly even the carbon footprint created by day-to-day business activities such as employee travel.
The claims against Chevron and Bloom -- made independent of the regulatory push -- signal the kinds of pressure many more firms may soon face as transparency efforts gain momentum.
Chevron's marketing campaigns portraying the firm as a leader in clean energy and environmental justice moved the groups Greenpeace, Earthworks and Global Witness to allege the messaging is wildly out of step with the company's actual record, violating federal rules against "greenwashing."
Testing the Biden administration's resolve to demand companies step up their transparency around climate, the groups last month filed a novel complaint with the Federal Trade Commission. The oil company calls the filing frivolous, saying in a statement that it is working determinedly to "reduce the carbon intensity of our operations and assets" and "increase the use of renewables and offsets."
Bloom also finds itself in an awkward place. A chancery judge in Delaware ordered Bloom to open some of the company's books to an investor suspicious that the firm exaggerates how green its fuel cell technology actually is. Bloom has argued that the investor's charges, driven by a research report from a group of short sellers, are inaccurate and misleading. But the court was persuaded by the plaintiff's argument that if the allegations are true, Bloom could be at risk of losing green tech subsidies crucial to the firm's financial health.
The pressures parallel a much broader push inside the Securities and Exchange Commission -- and in the governor's office and California Legislature -- to require thousands more companies to disclose a trove of data that reveal their financial vulnerabilities to climate change and the extent to which they are contributing to it.
The disclosures would force companies to dive deep into the ways their operations are vulnerable to risks such as extreme temperatures, flooding and wildfires. And companies would need to demonstrate how they plan to keep up with the big shifts in the economy that climate change is causing, such as the electrification of cars and trucks.
"We don't want to have an extra page or two added to the 10-K [corporate financial report] loaded with greenwash and banal statements," Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Northridge) said during a recent hearing of the investor protection panel he heads for the House Financial Services Committee. "We need to define and hopefully have numerical standards, measure, tabulate. We want to change the behavior of corporations."
The California effort, focused on companies that do business with the state, was motivated by the declaration of bankruptcy by Pacific Gas & Electric just days after Gavin Newsom was sworn in as governor in 2019. The electricity giant's failure to upgrade its equipment to withstand extreme weather led to the wildfires that wiped out communities and killed dozens. The PG&E financial collapse was dubbed the nation's first "climate bankruptcy."
The company had not revealed its massive vulnerabilities in public disclosures.
"It really hit home for us then how these climate risks for the companies the state is doing business with are a big fiscal issue," said Kate Gordon, director of the governor's Office of Planning and Research. She said the state is working closely with the Biden administration on assessing what climate data companies should be pushed to reveal.
Though disclosure rules imposed by the Newsom administration would apply only to state contractors, they could become a template for the SEC to use for all public corporations.
"California can play a leadership role in laying down a marker," said former state Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones, who sits on the state advisory panel examining the issue.
Some of the country's most influential corporations are embracing the push. The current patchwork of largely voluntary guidelines offers little clarity on how much disclosure of climate vulnerability and action is enough. Many companies are looking for a level playing field that does not put them at risk of sharing sensitive data that competitors keep secret.
The San Francisco-based cloud computing giant Salesforce enlisted in the push as President Biden launched his global climate summit last month.
"We are in a climate emergency," Salesforce said in a statement endorsing the SEC's transparency campaign. "There must be a globally recognized and formally governed reporting standard."
Yet others are more reluctant, anticipating that the inside information forced out in the open by new rules would give climate activists new leverage as they target companies with charges of greenwashing and securities fraud.
Republican politicians are mobilizing to block the Biden administration's effort. Lawmakers clashed over the issue at the recent confirmation hearing of the new SEC chair, Gary Gensler, a proponent of pushing companies to disclose their climate risks.
Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) accused Gensler of seeking to use the agency's "regulatory powers to advance a liberal social and cultural agenda on issues ranging from climate change to racial inequality."
West Virginia Atty. Gen. Patrick Morrisey, who is threatening to sue, accused the SEC in a letter in March of "federal overreach and political activism at its worst."
The debate has spilled over to the Federal Reserve, which is signaling that banks are going to need to take a far more proactive role in analyzing and disclosing the climate risks not just of their own operations but of the companies they are investing in.
Its board voted unanimously in December to join the international Network for the Greening of the Financial System, which promotes aggressive action in the sector to confront global warming and move more capital toward low-carbon investment. Other than the Reserve Bank of India, every other central bank in the world had joined before the U.S.
The move nonetheless sparked protests from dozens of House Republicans. Rep. Andy Barr of Kentucky wrote in an op-ed for CNBC that the move was geared toward "causing financial stress for industries that climate extremists hate."
The transparency fight is getting underway in the U.S. as many of its allies are far ahead in requiring companies to report their climate risks. France in 2016 began mandating that its large investment firms and pension funds disclose extensive information about their exposure to global warming and plans to confront it.
In the years that followed, according to a Banque de France study, those subject to the law cut their investments in fossil fuels by 40% more than the country's banks, which were not subject to the law.
"We can't reach our net-zero future without climate disclosure," said Steven Rothstein, a managing director at Ceres, the nonprofit that engages business leaders in setting and reaching sustainability goals. "You can't manage what you can't measure."

CAPITOL JOURNAL; As state burns, politicians mostly fiddle; Internal squabbles, budget worries and a failure to prioritize hamper wildfire fight.

Wildfires have always menaced California, and that will never stop, especially with climate warming. What we can do is make them more controllable and less catastrophic.
That's what Gov. Gavin Newsom and the Legislature are attempting to achieve -- a bit belatedly -- by pouring unprecedented amounts of money into fire prevention.
Sacramento should have been doing this a long time ago. Blame internal squabbles, budget worries and a failure to prioritize the wildfire threat.
Don't look for dramatic progress by the next fire season, although there should be incremental improvements. Given how far behind California is in addressing the wildfire challenge, and the natural snail's pace of government -- an agonizing trait of virtually any government -- this will take many years of consistent effort and tanker loads of tax dollars.
There's a sense in Sacramento of inevitability about major wildfires. Brush fires such as the Alisal blaze in Santa Barbara County have raged forever along the Southern California coast. The hills above Malibu are periodically torched.
But there's also optimism that the fires can be made less horrific than the blazes that have destroyed tens of thousands of homes and entire towns in recent years.
"The good news is we actually know how to make California's ecology climate-resistant. We're not just sitting back and saying, 'Good luck,' " says Jessica Morse, deputy secretary for Forest and Wildland Resilience at the state Natural Resources Agency.
Morse is a fifth-generation Californian whose family helped settle the tiny, historic, pine-forested mining town of Gold Run in the Sierra east of Sacramento. She grew up there. For her, wildfires are "personal, emotional and serious," she says.
Personally, I'm sick of hearing politicians -- starting with Newsom -- immediately blame climate change for our wildfire devastation. It comes across as: "Not my fault. Didn't happen on my shift."
Well, it is their shift now. What are they doing about it? Certainly, climate change exacerbates wildfires by drying out vegetation and making the blazes hotter and more volatile.
But, as Morse told me, "the climate crisis is not going to reverse overnight."
We must cope with the wildfire threat that exists today, not just use it as a talking point to whip up public support for slowing climate change. That's what Newsom seems to do.
That said, 2021 has been a banner year for legislative and gubernatorial action on preventing and fighting wildfires.
"We've finally put our money where our mouth is," says state Sen. Bill Dodd (D-Napa), whose wine country district north of San Francisco has been hit hard by wildfires. He's a leader on fire legislation.
"Last year, we spent $3 billion on fire suppression and $100 million on fire prevention. That just doesn't do it," Dodd says. "This year we're going to spend $3 billion on suppression and $1.5 billion on prevention."
The prevention money will go toward a smorgasbord of projects.
One sorely needed project is thinning dense forests by removing highly flammable dead trees and thick underbrush.
Much of this thinning is carried out by so-called prescribed burning -- what Indigenous Californians did to keep the forests healthy until Europeans shoved them aside and began dousing every small blaze to protect settlements and marketable timber.
"California's ecology was managed beautifully for millennia," Morse says. "Then the West was colonized. ... As a result of multi-generation decisions and climate change, we're now seeing catastrophic megafires."
California forests became overgrown with people, pines and undergrowth. The dense trees became susceptible to disease -- bark beetles in a drought -- and nearly 170 million now are dead, creating hot-burning fire fuel.
Both the state and federal governments have been slow to respond to the modern reality that forests need to be periodically cleaned.
"We had a goal last year of treating 500,000 acres but only did about 60,000," Dodd says.
Newsom signed a Dodd bill that will protect landowners from liability if prescribed burns on their forested property get out of control.
The record state spending also will be used to create cleared-out spaces -- called "fuel breaks" -- around forested communities where firefighters can safely place their equipment and battle blazes. Fuel breaks are credited with helping to save South Lake Tahoe in August.
The money also will provide grants for homeowners to create vegetation-light buffers -- "defensible space" -- next to their vulnerable houses.
There'll be grants for "home hardening," such as installing double-pane windows and finally getting rid of those wood-shingle roofs.
"This is a cultural thing," says Thom Porter, chief of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. "We're seeing fires that we've never seen in history, like redwoods burning because they're so dry. We need to embrace that fact and prepare our communities to be resilient.
"It's for certain going to cost a ton of money and require sustained activity."
Another Dodd bill signed by Newsom will create a new Office of Wildfire Technology Research to test better equipment and retardants.
"We're behind the curve on this," Dodd says.
As of Friday, roughly 2.5 million acres had been burned in California this year by more than 8,000 fires, dooming 3,600 structures. Last year, 4.3 million acres were burned and nearly 10,500 structures destroyed.
Reducing the wildfire threat should be state government's top priority. It's about public safety, shattered lives, crippled local economies, toxic smoky skies, and greenhouse emissions making climate warming even worse.
These last few years cannot become the status quo. That's unacceptable. The public needs to hold the politicians' feet to the fire.

Dressed as endangered fish, tigers and other threatened species, demonstrators marched through Brussels on Sunday to push world leaders to take bolder action to fight climate change at the United Nations climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, starting this month.
Thousands of people and 80 organizations took part in the protest, aiming for the biggest such event in the European Union's capital since the start of the pandemic, which halted the climate movement's weekly marches.
Cyclists, families with children and white-haired demonstrators filled city streets, chanting slogans demanding climate justice and waving banners in English, French and Dutch. One carried a stuffed polar bear on her head, and others were dressed as animals endangered by human-caused climate change.
"After you've seen all the disasters we have seen this summer, it's really crucial that we move now. Because everybody knows what the problem is," said Xavier De Wannemaeker, a protester with Extinction Rebellion.
Scientists say there's little doubt that fuel emissions are contributing to extreme weather events such as the droughts, fires and floods that have hit regions around the world this summer.
Demonstrator Lucien Dewanaga asked, "What do we do when we destroy the planet? We have nothing else. Human beings have to live in this world. And there is only one world."
Environmentalists worry that the U.N.'s 26th Climate Change Conference of the Parties, known as the COP26, in Glasgow starting Oct. 31, will produce policies that don't do enough to slash carbon emissions and slow the warming of the planet.
The 12-day summit aims to secure more ambitious commitments to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) with a goal of keeping it to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) compared with preindustrial levels. The event also is focused on mobilizing financing to fight climate change and protecting vulnerable communities and natural habitats.
The crowd at Sunday's protest included a mix of people with and without masks.
With one of the world's highest vaccination rates, Belgium is starting to ease virus restrictions and allow such gatherings again.

PERSPECTIVES; 3 win physics Nobel for work on climate, disorder; Patterns they found in seeming chaos allow predictions of global warming and more.

Three scientists won the Nobel Prize in physics Tuesday for work that found order in seeming disorder, helping to explain and predict complex forces of nature, including expanding our understanding of climate change.
Syukuro Manabe, born in Japan, and Klaus Hasselmann of Germany were cited for their work in "the physical modeling of Earth's climate, quantifying variability and reliably predicting global warming."
The second half of the prize was awarded to Giorgio Parisi of Italy for "the discovery of the interplay of disorder and fluctuations in physical systems from atomic to planetary scales."
All three work on what are known as complex systems, of which climate is just one example.
The prize goes to two distinct types of physics that are opposite in many ways but share the goal of making sense of what seems random and chaotic in such a way that it can be predicted.
Parisi's work centers on subatomic particles and is somewhat esoteric, while Manabe and Hasselmann focus on large-scale global forces that shape our daily lives.
The prize committee said Manabe, 90, and Hasselmann, 89, "laid the foundation of our knowledge of the Earth's climate and how humanity influences it."
Starting in the 1960s, Manabe, now based at Princeton University in New Jersey, created the first climate models that forecast what would happen to the globe as carbon dioxide built up in the atmosphere.
Scientists for decades had shown that carbon dioxide traps heat, but Manabe's work put specifics and predictions into that general knowledge. It allowed scientists eventually to show how climate change would worsen, and how fast, depending on how much carbon pollution is spewed.
About a decade later, Hasselmann, of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany, created a model that linked weather and climate, helping explain why climate models can be reliable despite the seemingly chaotic nature of the weather. He also developed ways to look for specific signs of human influence on the climate.
Hasselmann noted that climate change happens on such a large time scale that people have difficulty comprehending it. "People tend to deny the problem until it's too late," he said.
Parisi, of Sapienza University of Rome, "built a deep physical and mathematical model" that made it possible to understand complex systems in fields as different as mathematics, biology, neuroscience and machine learning.
His work originally focused on so-called spin glass, a type of metal alloy in which the atoms are arranged in a way that changes the material's magnetic properties in apparently random ways that had baffled scientists. Parisi, 73, was able to discover hidden patterns that explained this behavior, resulting in theories that could be applied to other fields of research.
In their work, the physicists used complex mathematics to explain and predict what seemed like chaotic forces of nature in computer simulations, a technique called modeling. Modeling has given scientists such a solid understanding of those forces that they can accurately predict weather a week out and warn about the climate decades in advance.
"Physics is all about modeling -- finding mathematical stories, their equations that accurately reflect how nature works -- and allows humanity to use science as its survival instinct," Brown University physicist Jim Gates said.
Some nonscientists have attacked and ridiculed modeling, but it has been key to the way the world tackles one of its biggest problems: climate change.
"Physics-based climate models made it possible to predict the amount and pace of global warming, including some of the consequences like risings seas, increased extreme rainfall events and stronger hurricanes, decades before they could be observed.
Klaus Hasselmann and Suki Manabe were pioneers in this area and personal role models for me," said Stefan Rahmstorf, a German climate scientist and modeler.
"We are now witnessing how their early predictions are coming true, one after the other," he added.
When climate scientists and formerVice President Al Gore won the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, some nonscientists who deny global warming dismissed it as a politically motivated award.
Perhaps anticipating more controversy, officials who spoke at Tuesday's announcement emphasized that the physics prize was a science award.
"It's a physics prize. What we are saying is that the modeling of climate is solidly based on physical theory and well-known physics," Swedish physicist and Nobel committee member Thors Hans Hansson said at the announcement.
While Parisi's work was not focused on climate, he spoke of the pressing problems facing the planet.
"It's very urgent that we take very strong decisions and move at a very strong pace" in tackling climate change, he said after the award announcement. "It's clear for future generations that we have to act now."
Asked whether he expected to win the prize, Parisi said: "I knew there was a non-negligible possibility."
Hasselmann, in contrast, expressed bewilderment.
"I do not really understand it, but it feels fantastic," he told the Sweden's TT News Agency. "I heard it just five minutes ago. I'm still trying to understand it.
"I do not think I have done too much research in my life, but I have had a lot of fun doing it with my colleagues," he said. "It is enough for me that my research shows that humans have actually affected the climate."
In Manabe's hometown in Japan, the mayor heralded his win.
"I represent all the city residents to offer my heartfelt congratulations" to Manabe, said Minoru Shinohara, mayor of Shikokuchuo. Manabe grew up in the city's Shingu village.
It is common for several scientists who work in related fields to share the prize.
Last year, the prize went to UCLA professor Andrea Ghez, Roger Penrose of Britain and Reinhard Genzel of Germany for their research on black holes.
The prestigious award comes with a gold medal and 10 million Swedish kronor (more than $1.14 million). The money comes from a bequest left by the prize's creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel, who died in 1896.
On Monday, the Nobel Committee awarded the prize in medicine to California scientists David Julius and Ardem Patapoutian for their discoveries on how the human body perceives temperature and touch.
Over the coming days, prizes will be awarded for outstanding work in the fields of chemistry, literature, peace and economics.

Potentially record-breaking temperatures are on their way to wide swaths of Southern California -- a scorcher scientists say is clearly tied to climate change and could be lethal for those unprepared.
"Heat waves are killers," said retired oceanographer and climatologist William Patzert, noting that more and more people in the Southwest and elsewhere are exposed to dangerous temperatures, even inside their homes.
A heat warning is in effect for the Santa Clarita Valley, Antelope Valley and parts of the Los Angeles County mountains, set to expire over Sunday and Monday.
The National Weather Service expects "dangerously hot conditions," with temperatures up to 113 degrees in the Antelope Valley -- potentially record-breaking heat for this time of year, according to meteorologist David Sweet.
If the Antelope Valley reaches 113 degrees this weekend, it will be far from the first heat record broken in Southern California this summer.
"All three of our desert climate sites (Palm Springs, Thermal and Anza- Borrego) experienced their hottest June on record, with mean monthly temperatures of 93.5 F, 91.0 F, and 91.7 F respectively," the National Weather Service's office in San Diego tweeted Tuesday.
Temperatures of 120 to 128 are expected over the weekend in Death Valley, with daily record high temperatures "likely to be rivaled or broken," according to the weather service.
With highs expected near 112 degrees, "we could be looking at some daily records in Fresno, especially on Sunday and Monday," said meteorologist Colin McKellar at the National Weather Service's Hanford office. In addition, Bakersfield, Merced and other areas of the Central Valley may break daily heat records over the weekend into Monday, McKellar said.
The Indian Wells Valley may experience its hottest day on record, McKellar said, with a high near 118 degrees possible on Saturday.
The Palm Springs area is also expecting a potentially record-breaking heat wave this weekend, with temperatures up to 121 expected across the Coachella Valley, according to the National Weather Service. This weekend, "it's going to be pretty close, probably within a few degrees of some daily records," said meteorologist Bruno Rodriguez with the National Weather Service's San Diego office.
The hot weekend comes after a "mega heat dome" struck the Pacific Northwest and western Canada earlier this month, killing hundreds, igniting fires and prompting a study that quickly tied it to climate change.
This incoming heat wave can also be attributed to a warming planet, said Patzert.
"Over the past 60 years, every decade has been hotter than the previous decade. None of this should be a surprise," he said. "We've had what I would call a tipping point or a crisis here with regard to heat waves."
Heat poses a serious risk to human health, Patzert explained, especially when it surpasses 95 degrees. "That's when the human body starts to have negative reactions," he said. With climate change, "we're spending more and more time over that [95 degree] threshold at various locations, especially in the West."
The extreme temperatures will be particularly dangerous "for those working or participating in outdoor activities," the heat alert for the Antelope Valley explains. The National Weather Service predicts overnight temperatures will remain "very warm" in the area, hovering in the mid-70s to mid-80s.
Residents in high heat areas should drink fluids, avoid spending time in the sun and check on family members and neighbors periodically. Adults and pets should not be left in vehicles, the National Weather Service warns.
Free, air-conditioned cooling centers are available across L.A. County, with a list of locations at ready.lacounty.gov/heat. Additional tips for extreme heat can be found at publichealth.lacounty.gov.
Heat-related illness can be serious and life-threatening. Anyone suffering from signs of heat stroke should call 911.
With the heat and dry conditions also come an elevated fire risk, Sweet said. The National Weather Service urges residents to use caution with any potential flame sources, as fires continue to blaze across the state.
Climate change, heat waves and unhealthy forests are combining to compound the threat of blazes, Patzert said. "The great forests, the Sierra and the Rockies becoming more and more desiccated and more prone to these extreme fire situations."
In addition to the Antelope Valley, heat warnings are in effect for many other areas in California, such as the Cuyama Valley, parts of San Luis Obispo County, and large swaths of San Bernardino and Riverside counties.
Heat waves shine a glaring light on both local and global inequities, experts say.
In low-income neighborhoods, with fewer trees and less access to air conditioning, "the heat wave is more punishing," Patzert said. "As CO2 levels in the atmosphere continue to rise, the misery level across the planet will certainly follow."
"If we don't do some serious environmental mediation, which means weaning ourselves off fossil fuel, and considerable adaptation, which means making air conditioning more available for more people, the heat waves of 2021 will seem mild in 2031," Patzert said. "We'll be referring to 2021 as the good old days."

Desert cities grow hotter yet amid climate threat

The mustard-colored apartments built as public housing more than half a century ago are among the hottest spots in Phoenix, with only a few scrawny trees and metal clothesline poles offering shade in dusty courtyards.
The two-story stucco structures in Edison-Eastlake, a historically Black neighborhood that has become majority Latino, are among the last still standing halfway through a six-year redevelopment project that aims to better protect residents from extreme heat amid a mega-drought in the West.
Phoenix was always scorching, but climate change has made the nation's fifth-largest city even hotter, with temperatures in early September still climbing to 111 degrees. Conditions weren't much better in Las Vegas, some 300 miles to the north, where the thermometer hit 106 degrees.
But in one of the more remarkable findings from the 2020 census, the searing weather has not deterred Americans from settling in such places. The desert cities are in two of the five fastest-growing counties in the U.S., and new population data show that people keep flocking to communities where climate change makes life more uncomfortable and more precarious.
"In the Southwest, we are now in the process of re-imagining our environment," said Nancy Brune, executive director of Nevada's nonprofit Guinn Center, a think tank that has studied how extreme heat affects communities. "We have to consciously ensure that we and our buildings can withstand the heat."
Jobs have driven much of the growth. According to a recent census report, business investments in the desert Southwest expanded by more than twice the national average every decade between 1950 and 2010 and continue to increase, with healthcare growth leading the way.
But the burgeoning population also exposes more people to peril.
A risk index map by the Federal Emergency Management Agency found that the nation's five fastest-growing cities -- Phoenix, Las Vegas, Houston, Fort Worth and Seattle -- are in counties at relatively high to very high risk of natural disaster. The risks include hurricanes, flooding, wildfires and heat waves -- all phenomena associated with climate change.
The people at greatest risk are often in poor and racially diverse communities where many households lack the means to cope with disasters, including heat waves that are more frequent, widespread and severe.
"Until people recognize that extreme heat is a critical problem, we are not going to see critical changes," said Eva Olivas, executive director of the nonprofit Phoenix Revitalization Corp., which helps revive neighborhoods.
Her nonprofit and others have sought insight from Edison-Eastlake residents like Rosalyn Gorden, who described sitting on blistering metal bus benches and competing with homeless individuals for shade.
The original public housing did not have air conditioners, said Gorden, who now lives in a newer complex.
"The older buildings just had swamp coolers that because of their age frequently had to be serviced or repaired," she said, referring to the coolers typically placed in or by a window that circulate evaporated water.
Extreme heat is the leading cause of weather-related deaths, triggering heatstroke, heart attacks and kidney failure, especially in desert locales where people don't always realize they are overheated because sweat dries rapidly in the arid air.
More than one-third of the world's annual heat deaths are directly attributable to global warming, according to a study published in May in the journal Nature Climate Change. It included about 200 U.S. cities and found more than 1,100 yearly deaths from climate-change-caused heat, many in the East and Midwest, where many homes lack air conditioning.
In the West, Phoenix's Maricopa County recorded 323 heat-related deaths in 2020. Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, had 82.
The rising death tolls are challenging governments to protect vulnerable populations and to ensure there is enough water for everyone as the drought and increasingly hot summers drain reservoirs fed by the Colorado River.
Those challenges will only grow as cities keep attracting more people.
Maricopa County's population jumped 15.8% over the last decade to 4.4 million as people undeterred by rising temperatures fled more expensive areas like California. Not only was Phoenix the fastest-expanding U.S. city with 11.2% growth, the census confirmed its status as the fifth-largest, its 1.608 million people surpassing Philadelphia's 1.603 million.
Environmental activist Cinthia Moore said she's watched Clark County's population explode as more people move to southern Nevada, even as her largely Latino East Las Vegas neighborhood endures more frequent heat waves.
"People here don't walk outside in the heat unless they have to," said Moore, Nevada organizer for the group Moms Clean Air Force.
Moore said the heat is especially hard on low-income renters who cannot install solar panels to save energy costs and must rely on landlords to fix broken air conditioners.
Three years ago, a 72-year-old Phoenix-area woman died at her home after Arizona's largest electric utility turned off her service for failure to pay $51. The utility this year suspended disconnections and waived late fees through Oct. 15.
Still, only 15% of Maricopa County's heat-related deaths last year occurred indoors. Most of those people had air conditioning that was broken or turned off.
The other 85% died outside, illustrating the dangers for people with landscaping or construction jobs, or those without cars who must walk, bike or take public transportation.
Researchers at Arizona State University's Morrison Institute and the Guinn Center recently produced parallel studies on extreme heat and sought ideas from community leaders in diverse neighborhoods in Phoenix and Las Vegas. Many of them noted a lack of shade.
Both cities intend to plant tens of thousands more drought-resistant trees in vulnerable areas, but that increases the need for more water, especially with young trees.
Phoenix also plans to install 400 shelters at bus stops in the next few years. Phoenix and Las Vegas residents interviewed for the studies suggested adding water fountains, water bottle filling stations and misters at transit stops.
The nonprofit group Trees Matter is working to increase canopy coverage in low-income Phoenix neighborhoods of color, especially around schools identified by health officials as needing shade, said Aimee Esposito, the group's executive director.
Once home to Arizona's largest concentration of public housing, Edison-Eastlake suffered decades of crime and blight. With a $30-million grant from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the city is replacing 577 obsolete public housing units with more than 1,000 new mixed-income, affordable and market-rate units. More trees and other vegetation are envisioned.

THE WORLD; Tehran, and much of Iran, slowly sinking; Land subsidence crisis threatens 13 million residents as climate change hastens the depletion of water.

Pari Rahmanian and her daughters were sitting down to dinner in her brother's third-floor apartment in south Tehran when the ground began to move.
"There was just this rumbling sound. I raced to my daughters to get them out. I was sure it was an earthquake," Rahmanian, 47, said. When she got to the hallway, she realized what actually was happening: The building was settling in shifting soil.
"I've never seen anything like that before," Rahmanian said of the structure, which authorities deemed unsafe to reenter. "It's no joke. You lose everything you have in seconds."
The Rahmanian family had become victims last winter of land subsidence -- the sudden sinking of the ground, usually due to water depletion -- a growing crisis threatening Tehran's 13 million residents, and, increasingly, a problem across Iran, experts say.
Officials and outside experts have long linked subsidence in Tehran to over-extraction of groundwater, with the falling water levels causing the soil to shift and settle in many neighborhoods and at the airport.
"The disaster is rooted in the fact that 4 billion cubic meters of water are annually extracted from 50,000 wells, a third of which are illegal," said Mohsen Tabatabei, an official with the Ministry of Roads and Urban Development, in an interview with local media in June.
"We're seeing it [subsidence] in 30 out of the 31 provinces. Most major plains, let's say 450 of 609, are in critical condition," said Mostafa Fadaeifard, who heads flood assessment operations at the Iranian National Committee on Large Dams, in an interview.
The problem is particularly acute in the capital and its environs, said Alireza Shahidi, director of Iran's Geographical Survey and Mineral Exploration.
"In some countries, one inch of subsidence is considered a catastrophe," Shahidi said in a May interview with the state-run Iranian Students News Agency. "Unfortunately, we have recorded ... [14 inches] in the greater Tehran region."
By comparison, in Florida's Surfside, where a condo collapse killed 98 people in late June, scientists put the subsidence rate at 0.08 inches. (Subsidence is thought to be one of the contributing factors in the tragedy.)
The spike in subsidence here has accompanied a sharp increase in water scarcity, itself a result of climate change as well as a poorly maintained water management system.
"We've lost 30% of renewable water resources over the last four decades, meaning 35 to 40 billion cubic meters," Fadaeifard said.
In June, the National Water & Sewage Co. classified about 210 cities as "water stressed."
"This phenomenon will swallow people's houses, lands and the country's infrastructure," Fadaeifard said.
For months now, protests over escalating water and power shortages have erupted in Khuzestan, the oil-rich province in the country's southwest where temperatures regularly top 123 degrees. Khuzestan is known for its rivers, but many are now drying out because of climate change and overuse.
Similar demonstrations have mushroomed all over the country in recent days, often spurring a deadly response from the government, activist groups claim. Amnesty International said security personnel used live ammunition, killing at least eight people in seven cities between July 15 and 23.
With conditions increasingly untenable, those who can afford it are escaping Iran's hotter provinces to more temperate areas by the Caspian Sea in the north; others have migrated to Turkey, adding to the eightfold increase in the last two years of Iranians purchasing property there.
"Thousands of people, especially from Isfahan, have flocked to the north," said Moqaddam, a real estate agent based in the resort city of Kelardasht, a stone's throw from Iran's northern shore on the Caspian Sea. He gave only his last name for reasons of privacy.
"The price of land has quadrupled here," he said, adding that illegal deforestation had also increased so developers could build more housing.
The backdrop to the crisis is four decades of Iran's hostility with the U.S., and the devastating effect of Washington's sanctions on the country's economy.
With fears of all-out war on their mind, senior officials at the highest levels of government aimed for self-sufficiency, driving a massive food security program that has exhausted underground water resources in this arid country.
The massive agricultural expansion has resulted in roughly 90% of Iran's total water consumption being used for agricultural purposes. Around 80% of that is drawn from underground aquifers, depleting them at a rate many times over the world average, officials say. Many have turned to illegal wells, with about 30,000 in the capital alone.
Sanctions exacerbated an already bad situation, crippling investment in modernizing the agricultural sector, even as the government pushed more people into farming as the cheapest, easiest way to create jobs for a besieged economy -- a "suicidal mistake," said Jaber Khadivi, an engineer and head of an irrigation-systems startup.
"Unstable agricultural development has been a lurking issue for many years, but its mushrooming effect has surprised officials today," Khadivi said. "The government has long ignored the fact that Iran's arid climate and poorly efficient farming sector cannot fit in 5 or 6 million farmers."
Khadivi also blamed authorities for failing to invest in desalination plants, an integrated cloud-seeding program or smart valves that can measure excessive or illegal water consumption.
Instead, the government has doubled down on water management strategies that ignore the country's changing realities.
Over the last 40 years, for example, authorities have built dozens of dams -- Iran now has 192 of them -- to mitigate water shortages. But in the desert climate, a lot of that water evaporates.
The problem is likely to get worse, with projections that temperatures will rise by more than 4 degrees (Fahrenheit) over the next 40 years while precipitation falls by around 35%.
For people whose property is damaged by subsidence, there is little option but to move.
That's what happened to Rahmanian's brother; Tehran city officials evacuated all 10 families in the apartment building and demolished it.
Many other cases go unreported, with owners reluctant to inform authorities to avoid having their property torn down.
In 2019, horrible cracks began to appear in the office of Ahmad Reza, a 52-year-old business manager in a one-story building along the capital's main shopping thoroughfare.
"Our building had slanted a few inches westward," he said.
Authorities announced subway construction had damaged some structures in the neighborhood. Ahmad Reza called a government friend who said subsidence may have also been a cause. Pursuing the issue further could have resulted in the building being torn down.
"I didn't want that to happen, so I resorted to a private company to fix it."
So far, the repairs have held up, he said.
"It hasn't got worse for two years now," he said. "I have my fingers crossed."

RESHAPED BY A YEAR OF LOSS; Maya Lin makes climate change art in Manhattan and adds her stamp to a Smith College library

FOR MORE than a year, I've kept a folder on my desk that was stuffed full of scribbled notes for the story I was working on when the pandemic hit. Every journalist, it seems, has a version of this folder -- ideas rendered moot by the arrival of our global calamity.
The story, about the architecture of libraries, was also a story about how women design for women. The library in question was one I knew intimately: Neilson Library, the central library at Smith College, the women's college in Northampton, Mass., where I studied as an undergraduate. My focus was a $120-million renovation of that space designed by Maya Lin Studio, in collaboration with Boston-based firm Shepley Bulfinch, which had devised Neilson's master plan.
Shepley has a deep know-how in academic design, including plenty of libraries. And Maya Lin Studio, of course, is run by the designer behind the groundbreaking Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., as well as the intimate Langston Hughes Library in Tennessee. Lin is also someone with a profound emotional connection to Smith College: Her mother, Julia Ming Hui Chang Lin, landed at Smith in 1949 after escaping the Communist invasion of Shanghai on a fishing boat? her Smith acceptance letter and two $10 bills sewn into her dress.
In late February 2020, as the novel coronavirus crept into the U.S., I visited Lin at her studio, a comfortably worn loft space in downtown Manhattan. She described what Smith had meant to her and her mother: "Smith saved her life," she said. "If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't exist."
What began as a story about a building, however, ultimately became about how so much can change in a single fateful year.
On that crisp February morning last year, Lin said something that rattled around my brain for weeks.
At the time, she was working on an art installation that would place a grove of towering Atlantic cedars -- all dead -- in Manhattan's Madison Square Park. The piece, "Ghost Forest," was intended to draw attention to a native tree that has been decimated by habitat loss, invasive species and, now, climate change.
"We cannot continue on this path," Lin said as she described the need to work collectively to mitigate the effects of climate change.
Three weeks later, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic -- and our ability to work collectively was put to rigorous test.
In the 14 months since, there has been illness, isolation and death -- tolls so great they only register as abstractions: more than 578,000 dead in the U.S., more than 3.2 million globally. There also have been seismic societal shifts as the pandemic's inequitable tolls, combined with the uprisings for Black lives, force us to reckon with systemic disenfranchisement.
Like every other institution that wasn't Wall Street, Smith College was battered by the pandemic. A $35-million shortfall in its 2020-21 budget forced Smith to increase its endowment draw. The senior leadership team took voluntary pay cuts; more than 200 staff members were furloughed. (All but one returned.)
Though the library was being paid for out of a separate capital budget and had been financed, in part, by almost $43 million in private philanthropy, the high-profile construction project feels ill-timed. (Full disclosure: I served on Smith's alumni association board for three years in the aughts and spent another three years on an alumni committee that helped support the libraries by raising funds for author lectures and digitization efforts. I had no role, decision-making or otherwise, in the renovation plans.)
In addition, the college found itself in the crucible of the cancel-culture wars this winter after the public resignation of a librarian who alleged a "racially hostile environment" toward white people, and the resurfacing of a 2018 incident in which a Black student alleged discrimination after being questioned by a campus police officer while eating in a dorm area. (A later inquiry found that the area had been closed to Smith students and faculty for the summer and that this may have motivated the initial call.)
Smith's situation is hardly unique. At The Times, the pandemic's economic crunch resulted in layoffs and furloughs. And we've contended with reckonings over our legacy, both to the communities we serve and our own staff.
Lin, meanwhile, was grappling with the rising tide of hate directed at Asian Americans
"I was in the subway in February of last year and I sneezed and the entire subway car moved away from me," she said in a telephone interview. "I started hearing from friends of mine who are Asian how they were being accosted. ... I had a friend who was asked to leave a restaurant. I've had friends in New York spat upon and called horrible names."
"Before, it was spoken of but not publicly written about," she said. "It's good that it's finally being written about."
Moreover, earlier this year, in a cruel twist of fate, Lin's husband of nearly 25 years, Daniel Wolf, died of a sudden heart attack. Wolf was an art dealer who specialized in photography and helped the Getty Museum amass its enviable collection of more than 25,000 images.
He died in January. Two months later, Lin was at Smith for the library's unveiling.
"In normal circumstances it would have been wonderful," she said. "It's hard for me right now."
--
FOR A TIME, I wondered if there would ever be a good time to write the story I had carried with me for more than a year. But as I combed through my notes, I realized how urgent some of its themes remained.
Early last fall, Southern California had its worst fire season. L.A.'s air grew so thick with smoke it was impossible to see the sun; the daylight that did manage to penetrate it was sallow and wan. During the worst of it, my husband and I, along with our 65-pound dog, lived, worked, slept and ate in our home office -- the only air-conditioned room in the house. My pandemic weariness turned into despondence.
When I think of those days, I think of Lin's "Ghost Forest." In California, we are surrounded by ghost forests.
"The West will suffer in one way but the East suffers in another -- with water," Lin said. "The people who tell you climate change is a myth? Well, we're in it."
The installation of "Ghost Forest" was postponed due to COVID-19 but finally opens to the public on Monday. It will include a soundscape, accessible via smartphone, with calls and songs of animals once common to the island of Manhattan, plus a planting project that will place 1,000 native trees and shrubs in New York City parks.
"I didn't just want this to be about loss," Lin explained. "Our first public program will focus on nature-based solutions to climate change."
The project is part of Lin's longtime interest in ecological themes. For more than a decade, she has tracked the disappearance of plants and animals from specific landscapes through the multimedia online project "What Is Missing?"
Lin has regularly stated that "What Is Missing?" will be her "last memorial." She has no plans to design any memorial related to the pandemic. Still, she does consider the questions it would raise.
"For the memory works, I ask, what are the lessons we need to learn from history so that something like this doesn't happen again?"
But at a moment in which variants are tearing through India, and the dead have yet to be fully counted, we find ourselves struggling against forces of nature that defy comprehension. In that regard, said Lin, the pandemic and climate change are kindred disasters.
"It's a wake-up call," she said. "We have a lot of work to do. No one can be an isolationist. You can't save yourself from a global pandemic if you don't learn to cooperate."
--
IF "GHOST FOREST" touches on our critical climate moment, the Neilson Library project raises issues of representation that have become more pressing over the last year.
The library's special collections include extensive original materials related to gender equality, reproductive rights and other social justice movements, and it holds personal papers connected with figures such as Gloria Steinem, Marian Anderson and Sylvia Plath.
Neilson also represents something unique: a building designed by women for a client team of women for a public that would consist principally of women. It is architecture that quite literally centers women's knowledge at a time in which women remain underrepresented in the field. An estimated 20% of licensed architects are women, despite the fact that they represent half of all architecture degrees earned.
In addition to Lin, who leads her own small, namesake studio, Shepley Bulfinch, which served as executive architects on the project, is a majority woman-owned firm.
"I'd never been to a groundbreaking where everyone was a woman," Smith College President Kathleen McCartney told me during a visit to campus early last year. "It was six women with shovels."
The result is A library more adaptable to 21st century needs and more cognizant of women as scholars and subjects of scholarship.
The original Neilson, completed in 1909, was designed in a somber Renaissance Revival style by the New York-based Lord & Hewlett. But any grandeur the building had once possessed was pretty much frittered away by a pair of unsympathetic brick wings that were added in the 1960s and '80s -- the architectural equivalent of throwing a beige trench coat over an evening dress. These not only had the effect of transforming the building into a wall that split the campus in two but they turned the interior spaces into a dreary warren of corridors.
What's more, at a time in which learning is an increasingly collaborative process that requires flexible spaces for gatherings and research, the additions contained load-bearing stacks that could neither be moved nor rearranged. The old architecture was unable to adapt.
Lin tore down the graceless expansions, preserving only the shell of the original Lord & Hewlett building. A new floor plan was inserted and two gently curving wings swaddled in limestone -- known informally as "jewel boxes" -- were added to the northern and southern ends of the building.
Generous windows and an oculus draw light into the depths of the wings, which feature a range of flexible study and gathering spaces. The wings occupy a smaller footprint than the additions they replaced, returning some of the landscape back to the campus.
"The tendency might be to take it all down, to make it all new," said Lin as she walked me through a maquette of the building in her studio last year. "But the emotional history is hugely important."
That history includes her mother. A sunken garden adjacent to the northern jewel box is named for Julia Chang Lin, a graduate of Smith's class of 1951, and an important poet and scholar of literature who helped draw attention to poetry by Chinese women in the West.
In the old library, Smith's special collections had been buried amid the tangle of corridors. Lin's concept put them in an airy and prominent space in one of the jewel boxes.
"That is an intentional strategic initiative for us," said Smith dean of libraries Susan Fliss. "To bring more focus and relevance to the experience of these women."
In recent years, the college has worked to diversify these archives. Smith now holds papers connected with Latina reproductive rights activist Luz Alvarez Martinez, Mohawk midwife and environmentalist Katsi Cook and Byllye Avery, founder of the National Black Women's Health Project.

LIN AND THE TEAM at Shepley Bulfinch -- Janette S. Blackburn was the principal in charge of the Smith project -- are not the first women to design buildings on the Smith campus. Susan T. Rodriguez, who was then a design partner at Polshek Partnership (now known as Ennead), led the design on the campus' Brown Fine Arts Center, and Marion Weiss, of Weiss/Manfredi (the firm that will soon make over Los Angeles' La Brea Tar Pits site), helped design Smith's 60,000-square-foot student center in 2003.
And certainly, female architects have worked on designs for other women's colleges. In California, Julia Morgan famously helped design some of the buildings at Mills College in the early 20th century -- including the library and El Campanil, the school's iconic Mission Revival clock tower.
When critic Esther McCoy was given the Julia Morgan Award in 1987, she wondered in her acceptance speech if women architects brought a different understanding of how people use space: "Men may see people moving in space, but women can see them more easily talking in space, grouping up."
Still, it would be reductive to say that women design in any particular way because they are women.
"I design for people," Lin told me last year. "I don't think I design for women different than men."
But there is something about designing a purpose-built structure for women that raises questions about who serves as the default in architecture.
There is scale, for one, since women generally are smaller than men, yet most public buildings are designed with male defaults in mind. As someone who is 5-foot-3-inches tall and has spent a lifetime standing on tiptoes to reach surfaces and sitting in chairs where my feet dangle, I feel this intensely. And don't get me started on frosty office environments geared to the metabolic rates of men.
"The other thing that I think is really important is understanding the security aspects," Blackburn said via telephone last month. "Not just physical security -- whether it's women or men. But a sensibility called prospect and refuge -- so, wanting to sit where people aren't coming at your back, so that you can see the space in front of you. In a nuanced way, it may be a little more important in terms of how women perceive space.
"It's not," she added, "about certain colors."
Lin said her aim was to design a library that was "open and had daylight and was warm and inviting" -- which is likely to be the most resonant aspect of the building. After a year from which we have emerged lonely and weary, Neilson Library may just be the right architecture at the right time.
In a telephone conversation last month, Smith College President McCartney said she hoped the new library would offer sanctuary. "For [Maya], libraries were today's temples," she says. "They feel like sacred spaces. I just love thinking about libraries that way."
Emma Solis, a sophomore from San Antonio who returned to the Smith campus in the spring, said the library has been generally well received by the student body -- especially after so much isolation.
"People were really cooped up in their rooms, either out of fear or because they didn't have spaces to go," Solis said, adding of the library, "I like how you can see people." "Maybe that sounds weird, but in quarantine times, it feels great to see people existing."
And certainly, it helps when those spaces embrace their inhabitants in singular ways.
"Aesthetics feel more important than ever," said McCartney. "Beautiful spaces can transport you. And good architecture can do that too."
Lin may no longer be designing literal monuments but perhaps her library contains within it a monument's properties. After all, the purpose of a monument is to consider the lessons of history. They also serve to heal.
In the 14 months since I started this story, life has gotten smaller, more hermetic; millions have died and politicians around the world have challenged the nature of truth for personal gain. The Neilson Library, however, offers a site to delve into our shared knowledge and renew our sense of the collective. That's no small thing.
Our future depends on it.

E-CARS MIGHT SAVE THE PLANET BUT SCORCH THE EARTH; The state's push for electric vehicles boosts demand for battery metals that must be extracted from deserts and ocean floors

The precious cargo on the ship docked in San Diego Bay was strikingly small for a vessel built to drag oil rigs out to sea. Machines tethered to this hulking ship had plucked rocks the size of a child's fist from the ocean floor thousands of miles into the Pacific.
The mission was delicate and controversial -- with broad implications for the planet.
Investors are betting tens of millions of dollars that these black nodules packed with metals used in electric car batteries are the ticket for the United States to recapture supremacy over the green economy -- and to keep up with a global transportation revolution started by California.
Alongside his docked ship, Gerard Barron, chief executive of the Metals Co., held in his hand one of the nodules he argues can help save the planet. "We have to be bold and we have to be prepared to look at new frontiers," he said. "Climate change isn't something that's waiting around for us to figure it out."
The urgency with which his company and a few others are moving to start scraping the seabed for these materials alarms oceanographers and advocates, who warn they are literally in uncharted waters. Much is unknown about life on the deep sea floor, and vacuuming swaths of it clean threatens to have unintended and far-reaching consequences.
The drama playing out in the deep sea is just one act in a fast unfolding, ethically challenging and economically complex debate that stretches around the world, from the cobalt mines of Congo to the corridors of the Biden White House to fragile desert habitats throughout the West where vast deposits of lithium lay beneath the ground.
The state of California is inexorably intertwined in this drama. Not just because extraction companies are aggressively surveying the state's landscapes for opportunities to mine and process the materials. But because California is leading the drive toward electric cars.
No state has exported more policy innovations -- including on climate, equality, the economy -- than California, a trend accelerating under the Biden administration. The state relishes its role as the nation's think tank, though the course it charts for the country has, at times, veered in unanticipated directions.
"The ocean is the place on the planet where we know least about what species exist and how they function," Douglas McCauley, a marine science professor at UC Santa Barbara, said of plans to scrape the seafloor. "This is like opening a Pandora's box. ... We're concerned this won't do much good for climate change, but it will do irreversible harm to the ocean."
The sprint to supply automakers with heavy-duty lithium batteries is propelled by climate-conscious countries like the United States that aspire to abandon gas-powered cars and SUVs. They are racing to secure the materials needed to go electric, and the Biden administration is under pressure to fast-track mammoth extraction projects that threaten to unleash their own environmental fallout.
In far-flung patches of the ocean floor, at Native American ancestral sites, and on some of the most pristine federal lands, extraction and mining companies are branding themselves stewards of sustainability, warning the planet will suffer if digging and scraping are delayed. All the prospecting is giving pause to some of the environmental groups championing climate action, as they assess whether the sacrifice needed to curb warming is being shared fairly.
"Front-line communities affected by mining are asking the rest of us: What sacrifice are you making?" said John Hadder, executive director of Great Basin Resource Watch, a Nevada group fighting a proposed massive lithium mine at Thacker Pass, near the Oregon border. "You are asking us to have our community and environment permanently disrupted. All you are doing is maybe driving a different car."

California 'created these markets'
California began plotting in 1990 to force car manufacturers to make zero-emission vehicles. The cars were so undesired when they began rolling off assembly lines by the early 2010s that they were tagged "compliance cars" -- built and sold only to comply with California mandates.
Yet California, the global trendsetter on cutting tailpipe emissions, kept pushing -- until electric cars became not only functional, but stylish. Next year, 500 electric vehicle models will be sold worldwide.
"California's policies created these markets," said Matt Petersen, president of the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator.
The state's crusade -- including a ban on sales of new combustion engine cars and SUVs by 2035 -- has analysts projecting a surge in demand for the cobalt, lithium, manganese, nickel and other materials used to build electric car batteries. Need for these materials could soar by 600% globally over the next two decades, according to the International Energy Agency.
Electric cars account for 1.7 million vehicle sales annually worldwide, and that number could soar to 8.5 million by 2025, Bloomberg New Energy Finance projects. The transformation is happening quickest in Europe and China -- where more than 20% of cars sold will be electric by 2025. California aims to hit similar numbers by then, even as the rest of the U.S. moves more slowly.
The success of electric cars is a point of pride for not just California, but the Biden administration, which is trying to meet the commitments in the Paris climate accord. But it is also a point of panic. The administration warns the transition threatens to leave the nation vulnerable to the whims of countries that control supply chains. President Biden in June ordered the Departments of Energy and the Interior to help industry bolster mining and processing of battery materials.
China controls most of the market for the raw-material refining needed for the batteries and dominates component manufacturing; industry analysts warn the monopolization presents not only an economic risk, but also a national security one.
The cost of finding new sources for raw materials and loosening China's grip on the supply chains is large. That much is clear in Thacker Pass, a windswept pocket of northern Nevada where the Fort McDermitt Paiute and Shoshone Tribe has for centuries hunted sage grouse, collected plants for medicine and gathered for ceremonies. It is also the largest reserve of lithium in the United States.

A million batteries, a massive mine
A mining permit pushed through in the last week of the Trump administration allows the Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp. to produce enough lithium carbonate annually to supply nearly a million electric car batteries.
The mine pit alone would disrupt more than 1,100 acres, and the whole operation -- on land leased from the federal government -- would cover roughly six times that. Up to 5,800 tons of sulfuric acid would be used daily to leach lithium from the earth dug out of a 300-foot deep mine pit.
Tribal members and some ranchers are fighting the plans, alarmed by details in the environmental impact assessment: The operation would generate hundreds of millions of cubic yards of mining waste and lower the water table in this high desert region by churning through 3,200 gallons per minute. Arsenic contamination of the water under the mine pit could endure 300 years.
Pronghorn antelope roam amid the sagebrush that spreads for miles in Thacker Pass, nestled between the Montana and Double H mountain ranges. The sound of fierce winds is interrupted by the occasional call of a brown eagle or screech of a hawk. The Lithium Americas blueprint would transform the pass into a hub of industrial activity.
"Our Indigenous people have been here so long. This is our homeland," said Daranda Hinkey, a tribal member and secretary of People of Red Mountain, a group of Indigenous people fighting the mine. "We know every mountain in our language. We don't get to leave. This is our origin story."
Hinkey, 23, studied environmental policy at Southern Oregon University, examining transportation emissions and climate change and the green economy. "But we did not talk about things like this," she said. "We never talked about, 'Look at how much they are extracting.' We talked about sustainability, but this does not seem sustainable."
Many of the tribal members who gathered for a daylong ceremony on the pass recently shared stories of the fallout from the area's long history with mercury, gold and silver mining. The trade-offs for the jobs mining brought to Nevada's Humboldt County, they said, were cancer clusters, water and air contamination and broken promises to clean up the land.
Now tribal members are working with environmental activists, many of whom are living in a protest camp set up the day the Thacker Pass permit was approved in January.
"They would come in here with explosives, with heavy earthmoving equipment, and they would begin by scraping off everything that we can see here," Max Wilbert, a leader of the protest camp, said as he gestured toward sagebrush stretching to the horizon.
The mine permit was approved so quickly that the opposition coalesced only afterward. Tribal leaders initially raised no objections, and Lithium Americas says 40 members have already asked about jobs. But a new tribal government installed in the winter looked more closely at the environmental impacts and scrapped a nonbinding engagement agreement with the mining company.
Lithium Americas frames the project as a different kind of mine: less destructive, more connected to the community. Chief Executive Jonathan Evans says the company is seeking partners in the U.S. to turn the lithium into battery components.
"I don't see how you can fight climate change without batteries," Evans said from the firm's office in Reno. "We really believe in what we are doing."
He said that the company would backfill and restore the mining pit as it digs and that it aims to train and hire any interested tribal members. "This isn't your grandparents' mining," Evans said.
The green pitch initially impressed rancher Edward Bartell, who leases 50,000 acres of federal land for his cattle alongside the proposed mine site. Now he regards it as greenwashing.
"I actually was kind of excited about it," Bartell said, as he walked along the arid landscape where his cattle graze on native grasses and brush. "My view has changed dramatically." Once he dug into the details, Bartell said, he concluded the mine would leave his ranch irreparably parched and polluted. He is suing to stop it.
The tension at Thacker Pass does not bode well for the Biden administration's ambitious plans to shore up electric vehicle supply chains. Thacker Pass was initially poised to be a kind of demonstration project, highlighting how the U.S. is equipped to reassert itself in mining and critical mineral processing -- sectors it long ago ceded to nations with less stringent environmental rules.
The United States' one working lithium mine, in Silver Peak, Nev., produces only enough lithium to build 100,000 electric vehicle batteries a year. There are 17 million cars sold annually in the U.S. alone, and Biden's plan is for most of them to be electric within 15 years.
Extraction companies are exploring several more potential sites in Nevada and looking to dig in Arkansas, North Carolina and other states. A coalition of Native Americans and environmental groups is fighting to keep lithium developers from building a mine in California's Panamint Valley, at the edge of Death Valley National Park.

California's 'Lithium Valley'
In California's Salton Sea region, a collection of community leaders, environmental advocates and companies is trying to forge a path toward more eco-friendly production of lithium.
They hope to extract lithium from the brine generated by geothermal power plants. It was tried a decade ago in the Imperial Valley but proved too costly. The coming boom in the lithium market, however, has three companies back at it.
The state has set up a commission to guide development of what's been branded "Lithium Valley." It is a sensitive assignment in a region where farmworkers and Indigenous people have long suffered from toxic air created by agricultural runoff that became airborne when the sea's water level dropped.
"All the conditions here are prime for this type of innovation," said Luis Olmedo, a longtime environmental justice advocate in the Imperial Valley who sits on the Lithium Valley Commission. "But we've learned our lessons. People who care and are involved in this conversation are going to be much wiser on how they protect the resources of Imperial Valley."
Lithium is just one challenge. There are several other elements needed to build electric vehicle batteries that auto industry players warn could become scarce if the U.S. does not step up production. Plans for massive copper mines in Minnesota's Boundary Waters region and at Oak Flat in Arizona are drawing fierce local opposition.
Environmentalists and scholars question how much of this race to mine is driven by the public interest and how much by extraction and other industry executives exploiting climate talking points.
"I would push back against the narrative that there needs to be this massive expansion of new minerals," said Payal Sampat, mining program director at the watchdog group Earthworks. Some activists point to the abundance of raw materials being mined around the world, and argue that the focus of the U.S. should be on improving conditions in those operations and making the necessary investments and agreements to ensure supply is not cut off.
They note battery technology is advancing fast -- as is recycling technology -- and the materials that firms are clamoring to mine could be obsolete by the time they start tearing up the earth.

Scraping the seabed
The debate over how much damage should be inflicted on the planet to save it may be most intense far out to sea. The Metals Co. and others plan within three years to start vacuuming patches of the deep ocean floor for nodules that contain many of the metals that go into electric car batteries along with lithium. Many scientists say the timeline is dangerously irresponsible.
More than 500 scientists from 44 nations recently signed a petition against the mining, warning there are too many unknowns. It could destroy entire ecosystems, the scientists say, leading to potentially devastating consequences for the broader ocean. BMW, Volvo, Google and Samsung are all pledging -- for now, at least -- not to use materials mined from the deep sea floor.
The mining is not allowed under international law. The International Seabed Authority is only permitting the Metals Co. and select other operations to collect polymetallic nodules and conduct scientific research in a few dozen experimentation zones as the authority considers commercial-scale harvesting.
"Every single part of this nodule I hold in my hand is usable material," said Barron, the company CEO, as he showcased one of the rocks from the giant ship that had just returned from its six-week expedition in a remote region of the Pacific called the Clarion Clipperton Zone.
"It's like having an [electric vehicle] battery in a rock, and they lie on the ocean floor unattached," Barron said. "Compare that to the alternative on land, where we're having to rip down our forests, our trees, our plants, dig up our soils, to get to metal. That has enormous unintended consequences."
The company estimates that nodules on just a small fraction of the ocean floor could supply the nickel, cobalt, copper and manganese needed to build 280 million electric vehicle batteries -- enough to power every car and SUV on the road in America. It's a potent marketing point in the context of the environmental injustice unfolding at land-based mining operations.
The Metals Co. points as an example to cobalt, a key component of the batteries. More than half the world's supply comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo, where children are exploited for cheap labor. Amnesty International estimates some 40,000 children are working in the country's cobalt mines.
"A person buying an electric vehicle is probably not that aware of the fact that children are mining for their batteries in the DRC," said Bramley Murton, a marine geology professor at the National Oceanography Center in Southampton, England. Murton cautions against ruling out industrial-scale harvesting of ocean nodules.
"Unless the whole of civilization is going back to the Dark Ages and using horses and carts, we need these raw materials," he said. "We have to get them somewhere."
It's a complicated endeavor for many of the scientists on board the Metals Co. ship, who are not necessarily bullish on the firm's plans to start scraping the seabed by 2024. But there are few other opportunities for ocean scientists to collect samples and conduct research that far and deep in the ocean. It is a costly undertaking. The Metals Co., known as DeepGreen prior to an ongoing merger with deep-pocketed investors, is spending $100 million on an environmental impact study it hopes to use to convince the seabed authority that its plans are sound.
"I am not for mining and I am not against it," said Andrew K. Sweetman, a professor of Earth, marine science and technology at Heriot-Watt University in Scotland who was on the most recent Metals Co. expedition. Sweetman was overseeing collection of samples from a bulky high-tech machine that drops more than two miles into the sea and might best be described as the underwater cousin to the InSight Lander that NASA sent to Mars.
The contraption is enabling scientists to learn how organisms function in a corner of the Earth that is scarcely better understood than much of outer space.
"I'm getting the best environmental data that we can," Sweetman said. The seabed authority will ultimately use that data to make its ruling. "At least I know at that point that they have the best information that they can have to make that decision."
Others are less confident.
The seabed authority is being forced to cram its decision-making into a two-year time frame after Nauru -- one of 167 member nations -- recently triggered a clause in the authority's charter allowing it to fast-track a decision. Nauru's partnership with the Metals Co. presents the prospect of a financial windfall for the tiny Pacific island nation.
"Bureaucracy can get in the way of progress," said Barron. "Climate change is an existential crisis. We do not have the luxury of sitting around for decades to dwell on these impacts."
Yet many scientists say there are any number of deep-sea life forms that are too little known for debate to even begin. They warn that the plumes kicked up by harvesting machines could destroy ecosystems, damage the seafood industry and kill off critical organisms that could take lifetimes to come back, if they ever do.
When one deep-sea creature made its debut to humankind five years ago, the charismatic, milky white octopus quickly became a social media sensation. Its resemblance to a playful cartoon ghost earned the marine mollusk the name Casper.
The prospects for Casper are not great if the demand for electric vehicle batteries sparks a frenzy of deep sea harvesting. The octopus lays its eggs on sponges attached to the nodules metal companies are so eager to scrape from the ocean floor.
"We don't know what is down there," said Andy Whitmore, an officer at the Deep Sea Mining Campaign, which is pushing for a ban on seabed mining. "There has not been enough exploration and understanding of what life there is, how it is linked to higher life forms and what happens if you remove the nodules sustaining these organisms."

UNITED STATES OF CALIFORNIA
No state has had a bigger impact on the direction of the United States than California, a prolific incubator and exporter of outside-the-box policies and ideas. This occasional series examines what that has meant for the state and the country, and how far Washington is willing to go to spread California's agenda as the state's own struggles threaten its standing as the nation's think tank.

Second Opinion :: BIG IDEAS ON GLOBAL CHALLENGES; How California can lead the way on climate-protecting technologies

It's easy to be pessimistic about the problem of global climate change. For more than three decades policymakers have been talking about the need for action. Meanwhile, global emissions have kept climbing and warming is accelerating.
Yet unmistakable signs of progress are appearing. They aren't yet at the global level -- where the world's dependence on conventional fossil fuels has barely budged -- but rather in pioneering countries and states that are making big investments in the new technologies needed to protect the planet.
Here in California, signs of innovation abound. Electric vehicles account for 8% of new vehicle sales, and new policies from the California Air Resources Board aim to push that share to 100% by 2035. We are not alone as pioneers. Norway has already reached 60% market share for new electric vehicles.
On the electric grid, California is an early mover to renewables -- first wind, now solar -- which already account for about 30% of the state's electric supply; add in other renewable sources such as geothermal and the share climbs to nearly 40%. Progressive policies aim to ensure that renewables rise to 60% of California's electricity by 2030. And by 2045 all of California's power supply, along with the rest of the California economy, aspires to be emission-free. (How California will address emissions from all the products we import remains to be seen.)
Although climate change is a global problem, the technological revolutions needed to stop warming will start locally -- and, with the right incentives, spread globally. Pioneers like California matter, but successful leadership requires a theory of change that extends beyond borders. California's carbon emissions account for about 1% of the global total. By providing practical, successful strategies, the state can inspire other governments to adopt similar solutions.
California's investment on climate change has been substantial and increasing. Building on huge spending in the past, this year the state's budget surplus has allowed even more: about $4 billion to all forms of spending linked to climate change. Regulation can multiply that number by requiring consumers to make cleaner choices when they buy goods (e.g., cars) and services (e.g., electricity). Even as the federal government struggles to adopt credible and durable climate policies, California has been a reliable leader.
But some policies aren't as effective as they appear on paper. Examples include rooftop solar power, loved by voters because it is a high-visibility solution but in most cases economically dubious when compared with large solar power plants. (Solar on large buildings and organized across communities and microgrids fares better.)
Also suspect are schemes that allow polluters, such as industrial facilities, to emit more carbon than permitted under the state-established carbon cap by purchasing carbon offset credits. Often this involves buying credits issued to a forest owner who agrees to reduce or delay a timber harvest, thus in theory sequestering carbon in the living tree. While the concept is intriguing, careful recent analysis shows that these schemes are poorly designed and easily gamed, giving polluters a way to avoid what's really needed: actual cuts in emissions.
For California to set a durable example of climate leadership, it needs to look to new frontiers where big investments can change the world. Here are three areas where California could be poised to find answers.
First is natural gas, a fossil fuel that provides about a third of U.S. energy use, for heating, electricity and industrial needs. Inexpensive gas is the leading reason why the U.S. has cut back on burning coal. Though natural gas produces less greenhouse gas emissions than coal, it also contributes to climate change. Will we switch to other types of decarbonized gaseous fuels or something totally different?
Much of the world faces this question; California must focus on practical answers. That will mean building demonstration power plants that burn gas but can store their pollution safely underground. Also needed are demonstrations of other options, such as replacing natural gas with zero-emissions hydrogen in the gas pipeline system.
Second is integration of renewable power on the grid. Until recently, the big challenge with wind and solar was affordability, along with other renewable sources like geothermal. Today, no other source beats them on cost. The challenge now is keeping the grid reliable as the solar and wind power fluctuates during the day and the year. Even if far more of the grid is powered by these clean sources, we need "clean firm power" to fill in the gaps -- whether from gaseous fuels, new kinds of nuclear reactors or fossil fuels with effective carbon capture.
We will also need a lot more electricity storage. Bigger demonstration programs for these technologies, along with more pressure for federal support of the same, will help reveal which of these options works at scale.
Third, and perhaps most vexing, is human behavior. Most energy experts agree that making deep cuts in emissions involves electrifying as much of our energy system as possible and then cleaning up the electric system. Yet we know very little about how these new electric loads will behave. Vehicle charging, for example, could be timed to make use of extra supplies of cheap renewable energy. But, so far, drivers who buy electric vehicles have few incentives to align their behavior. We need to make sure that strategies aimed at electrifying transportation include detailed evaluation so that we can make those policies responsive to what really works.
Californians have long been pioneers in environmental regulation, not only in embracing new technology but also in building political coalitions that make adaptation and change possible. Addressing global warming will require practical answers in transitioning away from existing energy infrastructure. California's experiments, linking policy and industry, could once again lead the way.

Biden better make good on his climate promises now

Byline: John Horning, John Horning is the executive director of WildEarth Guardians, a nonprofit organization working to protect and restore the wildlife and the wild places of the American West.

Just seven days into President Biden's administration, he declared that the United States must "meet the moment" and raise our "climate ambition."
He backed that sentiment up with a set of sweeping executive orders directing the government to place the climate crisis at the center of domestic and foreign policy decisions. It was a welcome change from past presidents who have too often waited until the end of their terms to take any bold action to protect the environment.
To many in the conservation movement, Biden's words sent a signal that perhaps the U.S. was finally willing to address the climate crisis with urgency. However, now eight months later, Biden's climate signal has not only faded -- it's been replaced by a series of confounding mixed messages.
On Sept. 20, a federal judge in California rebuked the Biden administration in a lawsuit involving the failure to protect the Joshua tree, a species so iconic in the Western landscape that a national park bears its name. WildEarth Guardians brought this suit because the Trump administration refused to list the tree as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act -- despite all available scientific evidence indicating that Joshua trees will be in danger of extinction by the end of this century from climate-change-driven habitat loss, wildfire and other stressors.
The Trump decision not to protect the Joshua tree was fundamentally grounded in climate change denial. The Biden administration went along with that position and defended it in court. Judge Otis D. Wright II, appointed by George W. Bush, ruled that the Department of the Interior acted "arbitrarily and capriciously" in ignoring the scientific evidence of climate-change-related threats to the survival of the species.
The ruling was handed down one day before Biden took the stage at the United Nations General Assembly and asked, "Will we meet the threat of challenging climate -- the challenging climate we're all feeling already ravaging every part of our world with extreme weather?"
As the executive director of the organization that brought the Joshua tree case, I welcome all allies. Still, I was surprised that a judge appointed by a Republican president would understand the effect of climate change on an imperiled species better than the Biden administration.
Donald Trump spent four years eviscerating our environmental safety nets through the gutting of the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water Act, the National Environmental Policy Act and other environmental laws. Environmental and public interest groups filed lawsuit after lawsuit to challenge those decisions and many of the cases outlasted the Trump administration.
Disturbingly, when presented with the opportunity to reverse course, the current administration has elected on multiple occasions to defend these policies in court, wasting federal resources and contravening Biden's own mandate to raise our climate ambitions.
In late August, the Interior Department finalized a Trump proposal to lease 80 million acres of public waters in the Gulf of Mexico to oil and gas extraction. Weeks later, the agency drafted a separate plan to open 700,000 acres of public lands to fracking, the majority being in the Rocky Mountain states, including my state of New Mexico.
Both actions came despite Biden's executive order placing a moratorium on new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or in offshore waters. In its environmental documentation on the gulf sale, the Biden administration went so far as to say that a recent United Nations report highlighting the severity of the climate crisis "does not present sufficient cause" to reconsider the Trump decision.
To be clear, Trump didn't merely gut environmental laws, he hollowed out the institutions that would enforce the few remaining protections left. Thus, the impact of Biden not restoring those laws isn't just damaging to wildlife, clean water and the climate -- it also further corrodes the morale of the civil servants charged with carrying them out.
That's why we desperately need the president to direct his Cabinet secretaries to move more aggressively to use the "whole of government" -- as he said in his Jan. 27 climate executive order -- to protect our endangered planet. Moreover, we need citizens to raise their voices and demand accountability from our political leaders.
We will be joining partners in Washingtonon Oct. 11 for People vs. Fossil Fuels, a week of direct action led by Indigenous, brown and Black communities living on the front lines of the climate emergency. The demands are clear: Biden must direct agencies to reject fossil fuel projects and start treating the climate crisis like the emergency it is.
We're asking him to live up to his commitments. That could begin with standing up for the right side in court, but it must not stop there.

Sierra, turning to ash; Before a teen hiker's eyes, climate takes a toll

As a 17-year-old born and raised in the Central Valley, I grew up with the Sierra Nevada as my second home -- backpacking through sequoia groves, drinking alpine water and gazing at cobwebs of stars.
But over the past year, wildfires, a viral pandemic and college applications have limited my outdoor excursions. When I returned to my old home for a backpacking trip, I was shocked at the stark difference between the current reality and my idyllic memories. Even in just a decade, I've watched the Sierra wilt under the brute force of climate change, the sanctuary of my youth burning to ashes. How will it endure two more decades? Or four?
In July, my family drove to Kings Canyon National Park to backpack the Rae Lakes Loop, a 41.4-mile trail chock full of silky lakes and crumbling mountain passes. It was the first time we'd been in the mountains since the devastating Creek fire a year and a half ago, and years since our first glimpse of Kings Canyon.
An odd sense of emptiness hovered about our car as we slithered up Highway 180. The forest that once repressed sharp rays of sun had given away to stretches of black ash. The remaining pines, once capable of surviving subzero winters on 80-degree granite slopes, were reduced to blackened toothpicks. Even the immense granite faces and magnificent jagged cliffs of Kings Canyon were yellowed and left barren by the intense heat and wildfires of the past months.
I had known the Sierra to be unforgiving in its beauty and unpredictability. Having always been in awe of nature's terrifying power, I was pained to see the Sierra vulnerable, brought to its knees by human-induced climate change.
Though drought, heat waves and wildfires are all natural phenomena, climate change increases the frequency and severity of all three. They are also mutually reinforcing. As places like Kings Canyon heat up, drought becomes increasingly common. Snowpack levels drop, and clouds dissipate before releasing rain. Plants, animals, backpackers and farmers alike thirst for water from shallow, trickling streams. Trees and other plant life die of water loss and insect epidemics, fueling the severity and duration of wildfires.
The signs of climate change are all around us, yet we've staved off the consequences of our actions by sheltering in our air-conditioned homes and watching pretty documentaries, believing that Earth's resources remain pure and unmarked by human touch. But what happens when we can't protect even the most hallowed lands from our actions? Even during my pandemic hiatus from the wilderness, the power was shifting between humans and the environment. Nature isn't invincible; it never was.
That week, I found devastation in the scarred trees and dried creeks of the Rae Lakes Loop. But I also found hope.
Along the trail, I let my hands run across the freshly sprung grass near the riverbed and prayed for the many young saplings pushing through the fertile, black ash. Deer, large and small, roamed the forests and gulped water from the rocky beds of the Kings River. They served as a reminder of nature's resiliency, that even the deepest, most sacred folds of the mountains are capable of fighting humanity's reaching impact.
Thankfully, Generation Z -- my generation -- is anything but silent on the issue of climate change. After all, our future lives depend on new policies and cultural attitudes that will both preserve our natural world and ensure a safe and sustainable life for us and the generations after.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's most recent report warns that we're in "code red" ; our summers are only getting hotter, smokier and longer. It's only a matter of time before we're forced to confront the cataclysmic fallout of a warming planet.
I'm a senior in high school, and I've already backpacked hundreds of miles in the Sierra and summited its tallest, 14,000-foot peaks. Still, there's so much more that I want to share with my friends and family. I want them to feel the same terrifying awe of nature, to fall deeply in love with it, as I had so long ago.
Of course, the state of the planet frightens me. But when I see the blades of grass and saplings of the Sierra, I still feel hopeful. I believe, if we show enough passion and respect for each juniper pine and robin, that nature can still be saved from humankind. We just need people to care.

A new dry spell or an overlong event?; Climate change may have pushed the state into a 'megadrought,' researchers suggest.

California has entered another drought.
But depending on whom you ask, the last one may never have really ended.
As Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a drought emergency in Sonoma and Mendocino counties Wednesday, some researchers argue that California and other Western states are actually more than two decades into an emerging "megadrought" -- a hydrological event on par with the worst dry spells of the last millennium. Except this time, they say, human-caused climate change is driving its severity -- and will make it that much harder to climb back out of.
"If this drought was totally due to natural variability, then we would at least have the comfort of knowing at some point, good luck is very likely to show up again and this is going to end," said Park Williams, a bioclimatologist and associate professor at UCLA.
"But the knowledge that a fair amount of this current drought is attributable to human-caused climate trends tells us that we may have not seen the worst yet."
Williams was the lead author of a study published last year in the journal Science that analyzed ring records from thousands of trees across western North America to reconstruct soil moisture over the last 1,200 years. Their research suggested that 2000 to 2018 was the second-driest period, eclipsed only by a megadrought in the late 1500s.
"This drought that we're in now over the last 22 years has been as severe as the worst 22-year periods of the worst megadroughts that occurred last millennium," Williams said.
The team estimated that human-caused climate trends have accounted for about 40% of the average soil moisture deficit in the 2000s.
"To put it in plain language, that means that without human-caused climate change, the West still would have had a pretty bad drought over the last couple of decades," Williams said. "But it wouldn't have been nearly as severe as the drought that actually occurred."
Other experts are more skeptical, saying that while the Colorado Basin may be facing megadrought conditions, the same can't yet be said for California. But they agree that warming temperatures are making droughts worse and forcing the state to rethink how it manages its water.
Seasonal droughts are typical in California, with its Mediterranean climate. Summers are usually dry, but water supplies are replenished in the winter and spring by rain and snowmelt.
Annual droughts are also nothing new. "You will have these dry years and then in between you will get these really, really wet years," said Safeeq Khan, assistant cooperative extension specialist of water and watershed sciences at the University of California Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources. "They can be what we describe as drought busters."
But research has indicated the wet periods are becoming more sporadic and intense, and the dry periods between them are growing longer and drier.
For instance, in 2017, record rains filled surface reservoirs that had dropped dramatically after five years of intensely dry conditions.
"From a water supply aspect, that ended the drought," said Doug Parker, director of the California Institute for Water Resources at UC Agriculture and Natural Resources. "From an ecosystem aspect, I don't think our forests and our natural lands that rely on rainfall ever fully recovered from that drought, and now we're into the next one."
It takes more than a year or two of adequate rainfall for plants to heal from years of being starved of moisture, Parker said, noting the dryness also left some trees vulnerable to bark beetle infestations from which they will never recover.
Groundwater supplies also take years to rebound, said Hoori Ajami, assistant professor of groundwater hydrology at UC Riverside, who is part of a team of researchers that analyzed data from wells affected by climate for a paper currently in peer review.
"Once your precipitation has recovered, that doesn't mean your stream flow is recovered or your groundwater is recovered," she said. "Our estimate is it could take for groundwater between three to 10 years on average to recover."
When rain falls intermittently, over time, it's able to be absorbed into the floodplain and aquifers and to fill surface reservoirs, all of which act as a buffer against future deficits.
"But if all that water comes in three, four or five big storms, then you run into situations like flood control, where you're trying to push that water to the sea as quickly as possible to protect communities and property," Khan said. "So our ability to absorb and store that rain diminishes when you have intense rainfalls."
On top of that, the wet years sprinkled throughout the 2000s, such as 2005 and 2019, simply weren't wet enough to make up for the long-term average moisture deficit that built up over the decades, Williams said. That supports the idea that we are in the opening chapter of a megadrought that's been taking shape this whole time, he said.
Not all experts agree that California is in a megadrought. Jay Lund, co-director of the Center for Watershed Sciences at UC Davis, said that 2017 ended the drought for most people in most places, and we are now seeing another discrete event, albeit one that began while the region was still hurting from the last one. He wouldn't describe that as a megadrought.
"I think there's some truth to that certainly for the Colorado Basin, but I think as a more pragmatic matter for California, mostly not," he said.
And Khan cautioned against drawing conclusions based on models rather than data.
"Considering we only have observations that go back 100 years, it's very difficult to conclude with certainty that we are in a megadrought," Khan said. "If you just look at the annual precipitation departure, it does kind of indicate that we are heading in the direction, though."
Experts believe the increase in variability is being driven in part by rising temperatures, with the Western U.S. about 2.5 to 3 degrees warmer than it would be without human-caused climate change, Williams said. The heat has also promoted drying, accelerating evaporation from canals and lakes.
"The temperature is getting warmer and warmer, so that creates a higher atmospheric deficit," Khan said. "Every time the plants open up for photosynthesis they're going to lose a lot more water because it's hot."
The shift has begun to disrupt the balance of California's natural water storage system. The majority of the state's precipitation falls from November through March, much of it in the Sierra Nevada in the form of snow. The snow sits around in mountainous areas for months before it melts in the spring and summer, sustaining the forest ecosystem through its dry period and trickling down into streams and reservoirs.
But rising temperatures are causing more precipitation to fall as rain rather than snow, and what snow does accumulate is melting earlier in the year.
"For the last 50 years or so, about every decade we see about a 1% shift of runoff from the spring to the winter, which is what you'd expect to see with a warmer climate," Lund said.
That means the water is no longer available when it's needed most, and it strains the flood-control network during a time of year that already tends to be wetter.
Earlier snowmelt also helps prime forests for wildfires. During wet years, mountainous areas are covered with snow until June or July, leaving only a two- or three-month window for fire season before fall rains return.
"But now the snow is already gone, and we are just entering April," Khan said. "If we don't get any more storms, we're in deep trouble."
Already, vegetation is bone-dry and soil moisture is low, which portend an active fire season in Western U.S. forests, said Williams, who has done research showing that the amount of forest area burned in a given year is correlated with both temperature and dryness.
But last year's record-breaking firestorms were sparked by both historic heat waves and an outbreak of dry lightning. It remains to be seen whether those conditions repeat.
It's also unlikely that residents of California's urban areas will be told to cut back on water use this year, experts say.
But they warn that if conditions persist, that could change.
"What we have to understand is we don't know next year," Parker said. "It's that unpredictability that makes it really difficult to manage water in California."

The global climate report released Monday offered a dramatic reminder of the need to slash use of fossil fuels -- not just by 2050, when many corporations have pledged to stop scorching the planet, but in the next few years.
Scientists have said that zeroing out planet-warming emissions by midcentury is needed to stave off the worst consequences of the climate crisis. But there's a giant gap between the many companies that have pledged to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and the much faster action the new report makes clear is desperately needed.
"You can't get to those kinds of ambitious emissions targets without getting to work now," said Kim Cobb, a climate scientist at Georgia Institute of Technology. "There's a mountain of change between where we are here and where we would need to be."
Cobb was a lead author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's latest report. Hundreds of researchers contributed to the authoritative dispatch, which found that rising temperatures are already fueling worse heat waves, droughts, fires and storms -- events Californians know all too well. The report built on earlier United Nations-backed science showing the world must cut heat-trapping carbon emissions nearly in half by 2030, and close to zero by the middle of the century.
The vast majority of climate pollution comes from burning coal, oil and natural gas. Rapid efforts to reduce reliance on those fuels would lead to noticeable benefits for people living in California and across the American West, Cobb said. She pointed to ever-larger wildfires and ocean acidification that is beginning to ravage marine ecosystems. They are climate consequences that have already arrived but could be limited, depending on what governments and businesses do next.
"The longer we put our foot on the gas here with emissions, the higher we're going to push that damage," Cobb said.
The list of companies pledging net-zero emissions by 2050 includes major European oil companies BP and Shell, as well as American Airlines, cement maker Cemex and food giant Nestle. A similar pledge is reportedly under consideration at Exxon Mobil, the Texas-based oil heavyweight that has known since the 1970s about its role in global warming but for decades denied the scientific consensus.
Experts say those kinds of pledges are potentially helpful but wildly insufficient. And many environmentalists have slammed them as little more than a marketing tool for companies trying to show off their environmental bona fides.
To Jonathan Foley, a climate scientist who leads Project Drawdown, there are two problems with net-zero goals. The first is they're difficult to measure. "Net zero" technically means emitting no more carbon than you remove from the atmosphere, but Foley said this leaves a lot of room for companies to fudge the numbers.
The other problem is the timeline. Foley said he's a lot more interested in what companies are doing now to cut pollution.
"What are your goals by 2021 or 2022? And who is accountable for that?" he asked.
That could be an especially difficult question for the oil and gas industry to answer. The Paris-based International Energy Agency released a groundbreaking report this year concluding that zeroing out heat-trapping emissions by midcentury means bringing new fossil fuel exploration to an immediate halt. That's directly at odds with the industry's long-standing business model.
"The best way to be net zero in this business is to shut down," Foley said.
The actual work of slashing fossil fuel consumption will look a lot different across different sectors of the economy -- none of which is adding more carbon to the atmosphere than transportation, at least in the United States.
Carmakers including Ford and Nissan have trumpeted plans to hit net zero by 2050, with General Motors and Volvo aiming for 2040. Under heavy pressure from regulators in the Biden administration and globally, the auto industry has committed to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in electric vehicles and other clean technologies, including hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles.
But those commitments could change if consumers don't step up -- or if the companies have a change of heart.
While America's three largest automakers stood with President Biden last week as he set a goal of half of new car sales being zero-emission by 2030 -- roughly in line with what scientists say is necessary to avoid the worst of global warming -- that goal isn't backed up by a government mandate. The industry already backtracked once before on a climate deal with President Obama.
John Loehr, managing director at consulting firm AlixPartners, said what happens next is largely up to drivers.
"Whether we hit these targets depends on consumer demand, on what the consumer wants to buy," he said.
But what people want to buy could depend largely on how government addresses the main concerns with electric vehicles -- namely range anxiety, lack of familiarity and prices, which are falling but still higher than for gasoline-powered cars.
California hopes to offer a case study for the rest of the country, with Gov. Gavin Newsom ordering that all new cars and light trucks sold must be zero-emission by 2035. But the state's rebates and other financial incentives for people to buy electric vehicles are spread across several programs with hard-to-decipher requirements, and funding frequently runs out, forcing people to wait months for their checks. Federal tax credits, too, are running low and are more helpful for higher-income buyers.
"What we really need is to get everyone's attention, get everyone focused," said Dan Sperling, a former California air-quality regulator who heads the Institute of Transportation Studies at UC Davis. "This is urgent."
Electricity is the country's second-largest source of planet-warming emissions, and a crucial sector for rapid cuts especially as other parts of the economy -- including transportation and home heating -- shift from fossil fuels to electric power.
The list of utility companies promising net-zero emissions or 100% clean energy by 2050 includes multistate giants Dominion Energy, Duke Energy and Southern Co., as well as San Diego-based Sempra (the parent company of Southern California Gas Co. and San Diego Gas & Electric) and Ohio-based American Electric Power and FirstEnergy Corp.
"Electricity is the one sector I feel pretty good about," Foley said. "Wind and solar are a pretty good way to make money."
But many utility companies still operate coal-fired power plants that are among the worst polluters, in some cases with plans to keep operating them for decades. A recent Princeton University study on options for reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 found that coal "all but disappears" by 2030 under every scenario, and that natural gas probably must decline this decade, possibly as much as 30% -- a reality at odds with the many utility companies pledging net-zero while building new gas plants.
President Biden wants the country to get 100% of its electricity from climate-friendly sources by 2035. Scientists say it's possible, but requiring companies to achieve it may hinge on the vote of coal-state Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia.
California law, meanwhile, requires power companies to reach 100% clean energy by 2045. Gov. Gavin Newsom has acknowledged that timeline is inadequate and needs to be sped up, although his administration hasn't yet taken steps to do that.
Some experts say there's reason for optimism if the pressure on businesses keeps increasing -- not just from government but also from employees, customers and investors. Even insurance companies are starting to take climate change more seriously.
Forty percent of the country's 400 largest companies have made a commitment to go carbon-neutral in the coming decades, said Michael Vandenbergh, a law professor at Vanderbilt University who studies how corporations are responding to the climate crisis.
"I don't want to underplay the fact that government really matters," he said. "The way to evaluate private-sector action is not whether it's a perfect solution, or will solve the problem, but to ask whether it can fill in the gaps to do what government should be doing."
Companies in the tech and retail industries have led the pack. Microsoft says it intends to go not only carbon-neutral but carbon-negative by 2030, meaning it would remove more carbon from the atmosphere than it emits -- a pledge that depends on a massive scaling-up of carbon capture technologies. Apple vowed that its entire supply chain will be carbon-neutral by 2030.
Walmart, the nation's largest retailer, pledged in 2020 that it would eliminate emissions from its own operations by 2040, and since 2017 has been working to help its vast network of suppliers cut carbon. Amazon pledged two years ago to zero out its carbon pollution by 2040, in response to a massive employee walkout that called for the company to reach that goal by 2030.
But those types of goals don't always result in the near-term progress that scientists say is badly needed. Amazon, for instance, dramatically increased its emissions in 2020 as demand surged during the pandemic, using 69% more fossil fuels for its own delivery networks and measuring nearly 30% emission increases for new equipment and third-party transportation.
Cynthia Cummis, who works with the private sector to set emission-reduction goals through the Science Based Targets initiative, said she's encouraged by the more than 1,600 companies that have pledged to set targets that align with what climate scientists say is necessary, including AT&T, Pfizer, Sony and Visa.
"Now we've got to see if the commitments lead to validated targets and lead to actual achievement of the targets," she said.
Unless companies can start cutting emissions now, climate advocates will be skeptical of 2050 pledges. The global nonprofit Oxfam International released a report last week labeling net-zero targets "a dangerous distraction that could delay the rapid reductions in emissions that high-emitting countries and companies need to make if we are to avoid catastrophic climate breakdown."
Experts say there are big opportunities to reduce pollution now, if government and industry set their minds to it.
One of the biggest is methane, an especially powerful planet-warming gas that comes from pipeline leaks, oil and gas extraction, landfills and livestock, among other sources. It dissipates in the atmosphere more quickly than carbon dioxide but traps heat more powerfully in the interim, and it's a focus of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's latest report.
"We will land in very different places in 2050 depending on the near-term reductions that occur," Cobb said. "The take-home from the whole report is that the risks increase with each increment of warming. If you don't do that increment of warming, you will have a noticeable decrease in that risk. That's really the bottom line."
